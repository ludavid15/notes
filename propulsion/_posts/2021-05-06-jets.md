TSFC
: Thrust specific fuel consumption

SFC
: Specific fuel consumption 


For the sake of simplicity, jet engines can be analyzed as a quasi 1 dimensional system, that is, we only need to consider velocities in one direction. This makes our math much easier. 

### Fundamentals

$$F_{uninstalled}=\dot{m_9}u_9-\dot{m_0}u_0-A_{exit}(P_9-P_0)$$

$$"{Takeoff\ Thrust"\ F}_{gross}=\dot{m_9}u_9-A_{exit}(P_9-P_0)$$

$$\mathrm{TSFC}=\ \frac{\dot{m_f}}{T}=\frac{1}{g Isp_f}=\frac{f}{g Isp_{air}}$$

### Combustion

Combustion is still the driving force behind all jet engines. The energy added to the air gets converted into kinetic energy by a nozzle, thereby producing thrust. 

$$C_xH_y+\left(x+\frac{y}{4}\right)\left(O_2+{3.76N}_2\right)\leftrightarrow xCO_2+\left(\frac{y}{2}\right)H_2O+(x+\frac{y}{4})N_2$$

$$\phi=\ \frac{f}{f_{stoich}}$$

$$f_{stoich}=\ \frac{M_{Fuel}}{(x+\frac{y}{4})(M_{O2}+3.76M_{N2})}$$

Combustion does not always happen to completion and fuels are not made of a singular type of hydrocarbon. This means that as equivalence ratio tends to 1, actual flame temperature is lower than the ideal value. 

| Equivalence Ratio | Type of Combustion Environment |
| $$\phi<1$$	| Fuel Lean |
| $$\phi=1$$	| Stoichiometric |
| $$\phi>1$$	| Fuel Rich |
