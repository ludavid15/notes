A collection of lessons I've learned about working effectively. Before going any further, let me establish that the notes here are for myself. I don't know if any of these tactics would work well for someone else. I think most people arrive at their own version of the truth in different ways. There are hundreds (thousands?) of "self-improvement" books out there, so it's not like the world needs a another one. I've gone through a few myself with mixed success. Sometimes there's no way to learn a lesson until an event really makes it sinks in, and a strategy you once thought was silly suddenly makes a lot more sense. 

Also, when I say work I don't necessarily mean a job. It's anything and everything you spend time on. This includes your hobbies, your health, and anything else you care about.

## Part 1 - The Most Important Thing Upfront

### Attention

In our hyper connected, information abundant world, your attention is your most valuable commodity. Everything is out to grab a piece of it (social media, the news, Netflix). Backed with a decade of big data, they've all become very *good* at it too. Sometimes it feels like your biology just wasn't built to keep up with it all. Arguably, it isn't. 

But your attention is important, because that's how we achieve our goals. When we really focus our attention on something, is when we open ourselves to the most growth. A lot of books seem to return to this basic idea. *Indistractable*, *Ikigai*, *Flow*, *Getting Things Done*, *Deep Work*. Almost all of it can be boiled down to just:

*Focus on one thing at a time*

This can take many forms depending on the task at hand. Maybe focus means paying attention at a meeting, taking notes, and then following up with a summary and a plan for everyone involved. In this case, maybe an hour of focus is all you need. 

But as the objective grows larger, so does the demand. If your goal is to master an instrument, you may need to focus on it for years, or even decades. 


### Motivation and Discipline

Although we may understand the importance of focus, being able to focus is another matter. Unfortunately I don't have much insight offer here. At the end of the day, focus is a choice we have to make despite all the things out there trying to distract us, and that requires motivation and discipline. 


## Part 2 - Efficiency in the Day to Day

### Exploration

As days get busier, I've had less time to experiment and explore new ideas, but I believe this has been to my detriment. Exploration is when we find new ideas and build perspective. In the long run, this helps us find better solutions and grow beyond our current capability. 

### Writing down your Thoughts

Personally, writing helps me focus. The act of putting down your thoughts into words solidifies the idea. So when I'm working on a problem, I'll often write a short paragraph on what I'm thinking. Often, the act of writing helps me figure out my problem. And as an added bonus, I now have a reference I can revisit in the future.
