A few notes on the Agile method for engineering, based on on my own experience working on an "agile" team and Google's Agile Project Management class on Coursera.

Personal Impressions of Agile:

1. Agile is all about trusting in people. It's the belief that capable individuals will deliver better products. To this end, everything in agile is designed to make individuals feel empowered, supported, and motivated. It encourages people to think for themselves, and to think critically, instead of relying on tradition.

2. However, in the absense of process and planning, something is needed to guide people towards an objective. This is achieved by literally that - a reminder to everyone that the objective is more important than any plan or process designed to get you there. 

3. Ironically, rules or processes designed to promote agile can be inherently un-agile. Agile is a culture, not a process. 

4. Agile can be rather "capitalist". The disregard of rules and tradition usually benefits those who are loudest or already in power. Maybe rules and processes slow down a project, but they also protect people who are vulnerable. 


### VUCA

Before adopting an agile product management strategy, consider if agile is right for your project. An easy acronym to use is VUCA, which stands for:

Volatility - rate of change in an industry
Uncertainty - lack of predictability
Complexity - high number of interelated forces
Ambiguity - lack of definition

Agile is best suited for project that have high VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity). In constrast, if you are working in an industry that is steady, well-defined and simple, waterfall may be a better strategy. 


### Scrum

Scrum is a framework (alongside things like Kanban, XP, or lean) that implements the principles of agile. Within a Scrum organization, there are three roles.

1. The **Product Owner** acts like the customer, and sets the content of what to make. The product owner also prioritizes the backlog and promotes transparency with the development team.
2. The **Development Team** builds the product. A team should be self-organized, customer-oriented, and cross-functional. 
3. The **Scrum Master** facilitates the team and helps them work better (mostly through the practice of agile principles).


### Backlog

The backlog is an outline of all the work there is to be done. For each item, consider adding a priority level, work estimate, and value added metric. The product owner is typically responsible for keeping the backlog updated and sorted. 

> Descriptions of each item are usually presented as a "user story". This is an effective way to define tasks because it describes the "what" without stipulating the "how". This gives the development team ownership of the task, and ensures they keep vision of the goal, and not get bogged down by following a set of instructions. In systems engineering terms, this would be like using the validation field of a requirement in place of the requirement itself.  

To judge an effective user story description, consider if it is:
1. Independent - completion of this story is not dependent on another one
2. Negotiable - leave room for change
3. Valuable - should clearly explain the value delivered
4. Estimable - should have a clear definition of done so it is estimable
5. Small - should be completable within a single sprint
6. Testable - is specific enough to verify

User stories often follow the structure of:

As a **user**, I want to **action** so that I can **value**.

### Pitfalls

Here are a few pitfalls, which can derail the original design intent of some agile practices (and remember, following a process without knowing the reason is step number one towards bad design and delays).

1. Velocity measures the average sprint pace. This assumes that in each sprint we are completing the tests needed to deliver a completed story. If we're pushing the testing out, then it's likely that our velocity eventually plateaus. 

2. Velocity is NOT a measure of total team performance, and it shouldn't be. Ultimately what matters is the value delivered. Not to mention that this practice can create some really bad work cultures. 

3. Scrum makes use of user stories because they keep the team focused on the end product, and allow room for innovative solutions. Unless you're on a service team, you should focus on the "why" of your goals, and not the "how". 

### DevOps

DevOps is an approach to software engineering that brings together the development team with the operations support team. The goal of this collaboration is to build a more direct path 


### Scaling Agile

Since scrum teams work best for groups of 5 to 10 people, larger product teams need an adapted agile system. Common big-group agile structures include: 

1. Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
2. Scrum of Scrums
3. Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)
4. Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)
5. Spotify Model (of Squads, Tribes, Chapters, and Guilds)

But in general, it's important to remember that Agile is all about being flexible to deliver value. These frameworks are NOT meant to be definitive instruction manuals or a process to be followed. Instead, seek a balance of strategies and values that work best for your particular situation.
