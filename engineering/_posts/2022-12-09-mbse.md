With better computers, engineers have increasingly turned to model based systems engineering, or MBSE as a solution to the engineering process. After all, things like CAD, CFD, and FEM have enabled us to model complex physics, so why not create a program to model a project? 

<!--more-->

The goal of model based systems engineering is to improve upon two things that happen very slowly with traditional requirements documents:

1. A way to track the design baseline.
2. Once a change is made, an easy way to explore how it impacts other systems. 

So what aspects of a system can we model? Here's a list.

1. Physical Configuration
2. Function/Behavior 
3. Interactions/Data
4. Heirarchies/Definitions


#### Physical Configuration

Fairly straightfoward, we need to track the hardware, physical connectors, and physical properties (shape, weight, thermal resistence, etc.). If our project was a sentence, the physical configuration would be the subject.


#### Function/Behavior

Verbs. Things that happen. You could say that function is the first thing we choose. Hardware is designed to meet a function, not the other way around.

> Technically this isn't always true. When a heritage (proven) piece of hardware is selected, its function is already defined, and then engineers build the rest of the system around it. But maybe we just pretend like the function still preceded the hardware?


#### Interactions

Interactions can be very abstract, but are also very important. A function might include an interaction, (i.e. a satellite interacts with a ground station by sending telemetry), but a physical configuration might also include an interaction (i.e. the baseplate on a satellite draws heat away from the electronics). 

And inherent to interactions is data and information. What information is tranferred? How is information formatted? Where does information go?


#### Definitions

Definitions explain the words we create to group stuff together. If many pieces of hardware work together to provide telemetry, we might designate a "telemetry subsystem". These abstractions are an important part of communicating complex ideas, but can also get messy. Definitions are applicable to any of the three prior groupings: hardware, functions, and interactions. 


### Engineering in Practice

In real life, we often do not build things up from scratch. Instead a project is often an addition to, or a modification of something that already exists. Even though this is meant to simplify the process, it also creates a lot of additional work (as anyone who has tried to read someone else's code can testify).

### DoDAF

The Department of Defense Architecture Framework is an effort to generalize how we explain complex systems. Before getting into what DodAF is, let's be clear that DoDAF is NOT model based systems engineering. DoDAF only defines a set of "viewpoints", which each viewpoint showing a different aspect of the system. For example, systems viewpoint 4 (SV4) shows functional flow diagrams, while SV1's show a high level overview of the physical elements. 

Consider an analogy - in CAD, we build 3D shapes. When we try to represent them on a 2D screen, we must choose a viewing angle and projection, but there are likely some standard views that everyone expects. Maybe a cross section to show the internal structure, or a profile view if it's a flat plate. DoDAF (and in fact any system diagram) follows the same idea. 

| DoDAF Views   | Explanation
| SV-1          | High level hardware overview
| SV-2          | Detailed hardware overview
| SV-4          | Functional flow diagram
| SV-10b        | States and Modes transitions
| SV-10c        | Sequence Diagrams
| DIV-1         | Conceptual Data Model
| DIV-2         | Logical Data Model
| DIV-3         | Physical Data Model


### SV-4

This is the functional viewpoint. In contrast to an SV-10c, an SV-4 is the functional model of your hardware, and NOT necessarily your order of operations. 

In an SV-4, we can either state a heirarchy, (A consists of B, C, D), or we can show it using a flow chart (B, C, and D interact to accomplish A). The first version is known as an SV-4a, and the latter, more complex version is called an SV-4b. 

### SV-10c

This is a sequence diagram. In contrast to the SV-4, an SV-10c is not primarily to meant to show the structure of your functions and hardware performers. Instead, an SV-10c tends to be a more explicit (and better) representation of your order of operations. 

### DIV

The Data information viewpoint breaks down the heirarchy of data. Like functions, we can think of data both in the abstract, or by implementation. For instance, the attitude of a spacecraft is abstract (DIV-1). A set of quaternions stored into memory is an implementation (DIV-2). Whether those quaternions are stored with any identifying bit headers, or in little or big Endian is physical (DIV-3).

> CAMEO gives us many tools for representing data. Exchange Elements are the default unit, and can be further refined with Signals. For instance, an exchange element might be created called "Power Command", which refines into two signals "Power On" and "Power Off".
