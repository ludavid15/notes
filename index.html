<h1> Welcome!</h1> 

<p>
On this website, I explain to myself things I have learned. Maybe some of this will be useful for you!
</p>

<p class="message">
Before jumping, be warned that there are two types of pages on this website. Some are structured like a reference, with minimal explanations. These get right to the most important bits, but are not meant to teach you. Then there are the blog style pages, which I've written with a bit more narrative. These walk through an idea step by step, and would be more pleasant to read (I hope). 
</p>

<p>
Lastly, please bear with me as I continue to add features! To-do-list: hyperlinks, more pictures, fix equations.
