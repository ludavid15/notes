This is my website where I document things I have learned. It's my personal notebook, but also serves as a sort of resume.

<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
Hi, my name is David, I'm an aerospace engineer at Northrop Grumman. I mostly do model based systems engineering (MBSE), with a focus on data and functional architecture. I got my B.S from UCLA in 2019, and my M.S from the University of Michigan in 2021, both in aerospace engineering and with a focus on autonomous vehicles and optimization. I also wrote a thesis paper for my masters program, where I explored different image processing and segmentation techniques on ultrasonic scans of composite laminate panels for impact damage analysis. 
</p>

<p>
I'm curious about a lot of things, but at the moment, I'm thinking mostly about space systems engineering, agile, music theory, and machine learning.
