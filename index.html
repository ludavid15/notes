<h1> Welcome!</h1> 

<p>
This is my website where I explain to myself things I have learned. Maybe some of this will be useful for you!
</p>

<p>
There are two types of pages on this website. Some are structured like a reference, with minimal explanations. These get right to the most important bits, but are not meant to teach you. Then there are the blog style pages, which I've written with a bit more narrative. These walk through an idea step by step, and would be way more pleasant to read (I hope). 
</p>

<p>
Lastly, please bear with me as I continue to add features! To-do-list: hyperlinks, more pictures, fix equations.

<p>My grandfather has the heart of a lion, and a lifetime ban from the zoo</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t think orthopedic shoes would help, but I stand corrected.</p>

<p>I had to leave my job as a personal trainer because I wasn't strong enough to change the weights. I just submitted my too weak notice.
