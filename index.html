This is my website where I document things I have learned. It is both a resume, and my personal notebook.

<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
Hi, my name is David, I'm an aerospace engineer at Northrop Grumman where I do model based systems engineering (MBSE). I got my B.S from UCLA in 2019, and my M.S from the University of Michigan in 2021, both in aerospace engineering, and the latter with a focus on autonomous vehicles and optimization. My master's thesis was an exploration of image processing and segmentation on ultrasonic scans of composite laminate panels for impact damage analysis.

<p>
I'm curious about a lot of things, but at the moment, I'm thinking mostly about space systems engineering, agile, music theory (mostly jazz), and machine learning.
