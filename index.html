<h1> Welcome! </h1>

This is my personal website where I document things I have learned. Some of these are a direct copy of my notes from school, while others are more thought out like a blog post. The purpose of this site is twofold - both as a way for me to remember things, and as a place for me to write about new topics to help my learning.

<h2> About Me </h2>

<p>
Hi, my name is David, I'm a systems engineer at Northrop Grumman where I model and design satellite architectures. I have both a B.S and M.S in aerospace engineering, from UCLA in 2019 and the University of Michigan in 2021 respectively (with a focus on autonomous vehicles and optimization). My master's thesis was an exploration of image processing and segmentation on ultrasonic scans of composite laminate panels for impact damage analysis.

<p>
I'm curious about a lot of things, but at the moment, I'm thinking mostly about space systems engineering, agile, music theory (mostly jazz related), and machine learning.

Please bear with me as I continue to add features! To-do-list: hyperlinks, more pictures, fix equations.
