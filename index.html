<h1> Welcome!</h1> 

<p>
This is my personal website where I document things I have learned. Some of these are a direct copy of my notes from school, while others are more thought out like a blog post. The purpose of this site is twofold - both as a way for me to remember things, as well as a place for me to write about new topics to help my learning. 
</p>

<p>
I completed my B.S in aerospace engineering at UCLA in 2019, and then finished my M.S in aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan in 2021. My master's thesis was an exploration of image processing and image segmentation on ultrasonic scans of composite laminate panels for impact damage analysis. Right now I'm working as a systems engineer at Northrop Grumman, where I model and design satellite architectures.

I'm curious about a lot of things, but at the moment, I'm thinking mostly about space systems engineering, agile product management, music theory, and machine learning.

Before jumping, I just want to say that there are two types of pages on this website. Some are structured like a reference, with minimal explanations. These get right to the most important bits, but don't have much context. Then there are the blog style pages, which I've written with a bit more narrative. These walk through an idea step by step, and would be more pleasant to read.

<p>
Please bear with me as I continue to add features! To-do-list: hyperlinks, more pictures, fix equations.
