Classical fluid dynamics is a subset of continuum mechanics. That is, we don't really care what the individual particles are doing. 

> Continuums are characterized by the existence of shear, and by having continuity (duh). 

But watch out! When the density is really low, (such as in space) the continuum assumptions fall apart, at which point we switch back over to modelcular dynamics.

In general, we want to find the following properties as a function of location and time:

1.	Pressure
2.	Temperature
3.	Density
4.	Velocity
5.	Acceleration

With the above information, we can find things like lift, drag, work, & heat transfer (all very important for engineering applications). In a complete model, all 5 of these properties are closely related. Not surprisingly, it’s also difficult to solve for all 5 properties at once. Thus, the subject of fluid mechanics is further broken up into categories based on assumptions and simplifications. These assumptions allow us to make certain variables independent of other variables. The three most important “categories” are:

1.	Incompressible vs Compressible
2.	Inviscid vs Viscid
3.	Laminar vs Turbulent

Any combinations of the above labels are technically possible:

1.	Compressible, Inviscid, Laminar = Shocks, expansion waves, acoustic waves
2.	Compressible, Viscid, Turbulent = Turbulent boundary layers, supersonic wakes
3.	Compressible, Viscid, Laminar = Hypersonic boundary layers
4.	Incompressible, Inviscid, Laminar = Potential flow theory
5.	Incompressible, Viscid, Laminar = Creeping flow, boundary layer theory

We can solve any of the above scenarios by applying laws and equations such as:

1.	Thermodynamics
2.	Conservation Equations
3.	Gas Laws
4.	Continuum Mechanics
5.	Imposing additional constraints (i.e. isentropic, isobaric, isochoric, isothermal, steady)
