A collection of common chord progressions I've encountered. Though they come in all sorts of flavors and styles, many progressions are built on the idea of **tension** and **release**. We play dissonant chords to "push" the melody towards a nice resolution, which usually is the tonic chord (also known as the home chord).

### The 2-5-1

Starts with the minor 7th on the second, the major 7th on the 5th, and finishes on the root.

#### Minor 2-5-1

It's the same chord progression, but this is the minor version. The **ii** which is normally a minor 7th, becomes a diminished 

#### Extended 3-6-2-5-1

Notice that we are adding chords according to their order along the circle of fifths. For instance, in the key of C, the 3rd (E) has 4 sharps, the 6th (A) has 3 sharps, the 2nd (D) has 2 sharps, and the 5th (G) has one sharp. 

### Tritone Substitutions

This method is used on 2-5-1 progressions. We take the dominant fifth, and substitute a chord that is based on the note a tritone above. In the key of C, this means that the **G7** might be replaced by a **C#7**. This results in a chromatic sequence (**D** - **C#** - **C**).

### Diminished Sixths

Sometimes also known as the Barry Harris progression.
