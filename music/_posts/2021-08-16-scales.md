Major Scale (Diatonic Scale, Ionian Mode)

Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, 

More importantly, we need to know the style and color of a scale (major, minor, dom7, bright, dark, etc.)


From brightest to darkest (notice that we are slowly dropping the pitch of notes, in the same order as we would along the circl of 5ths)

| Name      | Sharps or Flats   | Quality   | Chords
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|--------------
| Lydian    | # 4th             | Major     | Major chords
| Ionian    | None              | Major     | Major chords
| Mixolydian| b7                | Dominant  | Dominant 7th chords
| Dorian    | add b3            | Minor     | Minor 7th chords
| Aeolian   | add b6            | Minor     | 
| Phyrgian  | add b2            | Minor     |
| Locrian   | add b5            | Minor     |


### Dominant 7 Harmony Scales

Lydian Flat 7
Altered Scale - flat 9, sharp 9, natural 3, sharp 11, flat 13, flat 7
Normally does not include the 5th, but the 5th is still usable in this scale. 

Symmetric Diminished - sounds like the diminished chord
b9, sharp 9, natural 3, sharp 11, natural 5, natural 6, flat 7
