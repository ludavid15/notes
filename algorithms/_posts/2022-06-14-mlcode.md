A short reference for using the Flux package in Julia to setup and train deep learning networks.

<!--more-->

An efficient way to use one-hot encoding (better than regular arrays)

```
onehot(1, 1:5)
```

And now setting up a neural network:

```
model = Dense(2,3,sigma)
L(x,y) = Flux.mse(model(x),y)
opt = ADAM()
Flux.train!(L, zip(xs, ys), opt)
```
