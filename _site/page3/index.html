This is my website where I explain to myself things I have learned. Maybe some of this will be useful for you!

Please bear with me as I figure out how to get some of my equations and images rendered correctly!

<p>Two fish are in a tank. One turns to the other and asks "How do you drive this thing?"</p>

<p>I didn’t think orthopedic shoes would help, but I stand corrected.</p>

<p>I had to leave my job as a personal trainer because I wasn't strong enough to change the weights. I just submitted my too weak notice.

    <p>Electric propulsion (EP) is, you guessed it, all about electric propulsion. This includes: ion thrusters, hall thrusters, resistojets, arcjets, and electrosprays.</p>

    <p>In dynamics, the goal is to predict the position, velocity, and acceleration of rigid bodies as a function of time through the use of Newton’s second law, F=ma. While the basic principle is simple, the key challenge of dynamics involves the definition of reference frames, vectors, and their relationships.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that F = ma is not the only way to solve dynamics problems! In the late 1700’s, Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced an energy conservation strategy, known today as the Euler-Lagrange Equations.</p>

    <span class="post-date">12 May 2021</span>
    <p>To be clear, when we talk about fluid mechanics, we aren’t just talking about the second state of matter (liquid \(\subset\) fluid). It honestly would make a lot more sense if we called it “flow mechanics”, but too many textbooks have been printed now to change that. In any case, we’re stuck with the term fluid mechanics, so that’s what we’ll be working with here.</p>

    <p>A subset of dynamics, where forces are neglected, and we focus instead on the motion of points and rigid bodies over time. At the core of this topic are a series of rules about positions, velocities, accelerations, and how to find them amid a potentially messy system of reference frames and motion constraints.</p>

    <span class="post-date">11 May 2021</span>
    <p>One of the common assumptions we make when working with fluids is that it forms a continuum. The individual atoms of a fluid are assumed to be tightly packed enough that we can approximate the collective molecular interactions. What are these collective molecular interactions? Well, pretty standard stuff actually. We assume that applying a force causes an object to move, or a body to deform. (Technically speaking, that stress is related to strain). And honestly well, that’s kinda it.</p>

<p>The reason this assumption is so powerful is because it makes our model <strong>continuous</strong>. This may seem pretty obvious at a glance, but working with stuff that is continuous is very different from working with stuff that is discrete! The reason as you may already have guessed: derivatives.</p>
