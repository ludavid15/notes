<p>
This is my website where I explain to myself things I have learned. Maybe some of this will be useful for you!

<p>
If I choose to start a blog, blog posts will appear here on the main page, but for now here are some cut and paste samples.

        Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 May 2021</span>
    <p>To be clear, when we talk about fluid mechanics, we aren’t just talking about the second state of matter (liquid \(\subset\) fluid). It honestly would make a lot more sense if we called it “flow mechanics”, but too many textbooks have been printed now to change that. In any case, we’re stuck with the term fluid mechanics, so that’s what we’ll be working with here.</p>

    <span class="post-date">11 May 2021</span>
    <p>One of the common assumptions we make when working with fluids is that it forms a continuum. The individual atoms of a fluid are assumed to be tightly packed enough that we can approximate the collective molecular interactions. What are these collective molecular interactions? Well, pretty standard stuff actually. We assume that applying a force causes an object to move, or a body to deform. (Technically speaking, that stress is related to strain). And honestly well, that’s kinda it.</p>

<p>The reason this assumption is so powerful is because it makes our model <strong>continuous</strong>. This may seem pretty obvious at a glance, but working with stuff that is continuous is very different from working with stuff that is discrete! The reason as you may already have guessed: derivatives.</p>

        Viscous Flow

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 May 2021</span>
    <p>Unlike solids, fluids deform constantly under stress (in other words, a fluid <strong>flows</strong>). How it flows is very much dependent on it’s <strong>viscosity</strong>.</p>

<p class="message">
Viscosity is to fluids what the modulus of elasticity is to solids. It relates the stress (amount of force) to strain (amount of deformation). Qualitatively, viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistence to flowing. Things like honey have a very high viscosity, while air and water have comparatively lower viscosity. 
</p>

<p>Viscous flow then, is the study of how a fluid’s viscosity affects its behavior. Viscous flow covers topics like boundary layers, low-speed flows, and small-scale flows. Coincidentally, the regimes in which viscous forces dominate is often incompressible, but this is not a hard and fast rule.</p>

        Compressible Flow

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 May 2021</span>
    <p>While viscous flow deals with liquids, or flows that are very slow, compressible flow is for your rockets and airplanes. In this Reynold’s number regime, the density of a fluid cannot assumed to be constant, but luckily we can ignore viscous effects.</p>

        Turbulent Flow
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 May 2021</span>
    <p>In general, turbulent flow is modeled statistically. Averages values are used instead of exact ones. Before laminar flow becomes fully turbulent, it experiences transition. Transition begins with flow instability. The point at which a flow trips into instability (critical point) is distinct from the point at which flow transitions fully to turbulence (transition point).</p>
