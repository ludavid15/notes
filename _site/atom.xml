   <title>Twelve Tone Equal Temperatment</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//twelveTone/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve taken any kind of music lesson before, chances are you were introduced to the western classical system of notation, otherwise known as twelve-tone equal temperament. In this system, each octave is subdivided into 12 notes, labeled A through G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of music theory is based on this system that it’s easy to forget what it is - a constructed language that approximates something physical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That physical thing in question being acoustic waves traveling through the air. These waves (like all waves) carry a frequency, amplitude, and waveform. What we call pitch is the first of these - the frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a bridge between music theory and physics, let us begin with intervals. If we define the note &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; at 1 hz and then double the frequency to 2 hz, the resulting note is defined in our musical langauge as being 1 octave higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In western music, two notes that are an octave apart are considered the same “note”. For this reason, they recieve the same label, although a number is sometimes used to indicate how high the note is. However, not all musical languages may recognize the concept of an octave, and after all, why should they? Even though we say two notes an octave apart are the same, they clearly are not - one is much higher in pitch than the other. Be careful to remember that the language we have shapes our perspective of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could continue to double each frequency (1, 2, 4, …) and find a series of notes spaced 1 octave apart, but this musical scale is pretty limiting. So how do we define other intervals? Well, let’s take other ratios along the set of positive integers.&lt;/p&gt;

\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...\]

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2/1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3/2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4/3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5/4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6/5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7/6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8/7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9/8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;octave&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;fifth&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;fourth&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;major third&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;minor third&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;??&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;??&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;whole step&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that each subsequent ratio gets closer and closer to 1. In this way we achieve smaller and smaller intervals. There’s also nothing wrong with 7/6 or 8/7, those particular intervals just aren’t defined in our musical theory language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are these intervals any good? Like many things, the answer is: it depends. They certainly &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; nice, but these all lack an important feature: they don’t return to the same point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a whole step: 9/8. If we start on a note and travel up 7 whole steps, we get to:&lt;/p&gt;

\[(9/8)^6 = 2.0272\]

&lt;p&gt;Which is NOT an octave. Almost, but not quite. Whole steps are also unable to build any to any of the other intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

\[(9/8)^3 = 1.42\]

&lt;p&gt;Which is neither equal to 3/2 or 4/3. In fact, this basic problem extends for any interval defined with the ratio of positive integers. This is where 12-tone equal temperament comes in. The frequency ratio for a half step is set to be the twelfth root of two.&lt;/p&gt;

\[^{12} \sqrt{2}\]

&lt;p&gt;This way, any pair of notes 12 half steps apart form a perfect octave. This allows us to freely move about the piano and play in any key, at the cost of perfect intervals ratios. The approximations of each perfect ratio in this system become:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Exact ratio&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2/1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3/2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4/3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5/4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6/5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9/8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;As decimal&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.333&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.25&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.125&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;12-tone approx.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.498&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.335&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.26&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.19&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.123&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, except for an octave which remains perfect, each 12-tone interval is very slightly off from the corresponding “just intonation” interval. In most cases, the variation is small enough that it very nearly sounds the same.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fundamentals of Propulsion</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//fundamentalsProp/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//fundamentalsPropulsion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to propulsion, it can be difficult to keep track of all the different classifications floating around out there. Props, turboprops, turbojets, ramjets, chemical rockets, nuclear rockets, Hall thrusters, and ion thrusters, just to name a few. If anything, it’s a testament to our joint creativity that we’ve come up with so many ways to &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help clear up some confusion, this section presents a roadmap - a heirarchy of propulsion systems to help you navigate this broad topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, all propulsion systems must achieve the same goal: generate forward momentum. And the only way to do this (that we know of … ) is to make use of Newton’s third law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s it. We have to push something back, and the action of doing so pushes us forward. Naturally the next question becomes, well how do we push mass back? The three answers we have achieved are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mechanically, by interacting with the environment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Converting a fluid’s internal energy into kinetic energy with a nozzle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If we have access to mass that is charged/magnetized, we can accelerate it with an electromagnetic field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ideas that we have come up with, but cannot achieve yet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Artificial gravity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wormholes (i.e. spacetime warping)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teleporters (technically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a form of propulsion, since we’re not moving mass from one location to another, but rather assembling a copy somewhere else)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not explicitly stated, all relevant propulsion systems work with &lt;strong&gt;fluids&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What is a good measure for efficiency?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
A: As with most things in life, very little is free. Since the goal is to produce thrust, a common measure of effiency is how much thrust gets produced per unit weight of expendable mass. Naturally, this is not so good a quantifier for something like a battery powered quadcopter, but for anything that must carry fuel or propellent, thrust per mass flow is usually what is meant by &quot;efficiency&quot;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanical-propulsion&quot;&gt;Mechanical Propulsion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group covers any type of system that captures momentum from the environment, and includes sails and propellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sails (whether on the ocean or in space) have large surface areas so that when a particle collides with the surface, the particle’s momentum is transferred to the sail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propellers operate slightly differently. Power is required to turn the propeller, and as the propeller moves through the fluid, the fluid is accelerated in one direction, and the vehicle is moved in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a force perspective, the fluid’s flow over each propeller blade creates a pressure gradient, which can be integrated to find a forward force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;propeller-based-systems&quot;&gt;Propeller Based Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propeller driven propulsion system are further classified by &lt;em&gt;how power is supplied&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turboprop and Turbofan - a jet engine’s turbine is used to turn the propeller. This is a little tricky, because jet engines are capable of producing thrust themselves, but they use an entirely different method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turboprop&lt;/strong&gt; - the jet engine turns a propeller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turbofan&lt;/strong&gt; - the jet engine turns a fan (like a propeller, but with more blades and also sits inside a duct).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Electric Propulsion - some power source drives an electric motor which turns the propellor. Batteries have poor energy density, which is why you don’t often see electric airplanes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gas Engine - relies on good old combustion with cylinders and pistons to turn the propeller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;electromagnetic-propulsion&quot;&gt;Electromagnetic Propulsion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with gravity, the weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force, electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental interactions of the universe. In other words, it doesn’t get more general than this. The concept is pretty simple - use electric and magnetic fields to accerate charged particles. Unfortunately, electromagnetism is weird, and this makes things complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propulsion systems under this umbrella subdivide into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrostatic&lt;/strong&gt; thrusters create a static electric field and accelerate particles from high field potential to low field potential. Gridded ion thrusters and electrosprays use this method.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electromagnetic&lt;/strong&gt; thrusters create a combined electromagnetic field. Hall thrusters use this method.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nozzle-propulsion&quot;&gt;Nozzle Propulsion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever put your thumb over the end of a hose and observed the flow of water increasing in velocity, you’ve seen a nozzle. Nozzles work by constricting the area through which a fluid can pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a mass conservation perspective, the fluid velocity must increase so the mass flow rate remains the same (this applies for incompressible fluids).&lt;/p&gt;

\[\dot{m} = \rhoAV\]

&lt;p&gt;When the velocity increases, the pressure decreases according to Bernoulli’s equation (assumptions: adiabatic, incompressible, inviscid, isentropic).&lt;/p&gt;

\[P+\frac{1}{2}\rho U^2+gz=constant\]

&lt;p&gt;This point is especially important. Nozzles convert the internal energy (pressure and/or temperature) of a fluid into kinetic energy. Thus to maximize kinetic energy, we would like to increase the internal energy of the fluid &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it enters the nozzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;increasing-the-internal-energy&quot;&gt;Increasing the Internal Energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are heating up now as we subdivide nozzle based propulsion systems by the mechanism through which energy is added to a fluid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electricity&quot;&gt;Electricity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thrusters of this variety convert power in the form of electricity into thermal energy by heating up the fluid. Your toaster oven at home does this. By passing current through a heating element, some of the electrical power is converted into heat, which radiates and convects to the air around it. This exact method is used in a resistojet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;resistojet&lt;/strong&gt; is a nozzle based propulsion system which adds heat to a fluid by means of a resistor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if two conducting pieces are placed very close to one another and have a high potential difference between them, current can &lt;strong&gt;arc&lt;/strong&gt; through the fluid in between. This action heats up the fluid, and thus we have discovered another type of thruster: the arcjet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;arcjet&lt;/strong&gt; is a nozzle based propulsion system which adds heat to a fluid by an electric discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;radiation-nuclear&quot;&gt;Radiation (Nuclear)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the word “radiation” may invoke images of nuclear power plants and dangerous x-rays, scientifically speaking radiation simply refers to the transfer of heat through a wave or particle. If you’ve studied heat transfer, you’ll know that radiation via electromagnetic waves is a fundamental mode of heat transfer. Radiation can also exist through particles, such as with the alpha and beta radiation you get when atoms experience radioactive decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of propulsion systems, this energy can be used to &lt;strong&gt;directly&lt;/strong&gt; heat up a fluid. Note the important distinction here. We’re not using nuclear power to generate electricity to power the engine - heat from the controlled fission reaction goes directly into the propellent. Thus we are firmly still in the word of &lt;em&gt;nozzle based&lt;/em&gt; propulsion systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main implementation of this idea takes the form of nuclear thermal rockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;nuclear thermal rocket&lt;/strong&gt; passes fluid over a nuclear reactor core, which gets heated and then accelerated with a nozzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rocket applications, nuclear thermal systems have an efficiency and thust in between chemical thrusters, and electromagnetic thrusters. While a few have been developed, this technology never caught on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In aircraft applications, nuclear systems have been proposed for high endurance applications, but this idea was never realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;combustion&quot;&gt;Combustion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally we’ve gotten to the biggest bucket of all - combustion based propulsion. That thing which powers our cars and cooks our food, turns out to be pretty reliable for adding heat to fluids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But did you know there are actually two modes of combustion? Deflagration is the one most people are familiar with. This is an open flame, or that thing which powers your car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other mode of combustion is known as a detonation. In a detonation, a supersonic exothermic wave expands out, creating a shockwave. Detonations are much louder and less stable than deflagration combustion, but have the theoretical capacity to be more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;detonation-combustion-propulsion&quot;&gt;Detonation Combustion Propulsion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, only two detonation engine designs have been designed and tested. These are the pulse detonation engine, and rotating detonation engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deflagration-combustion-propulsion&quot;&gt;Deflagration Combustion Propulsion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the bulk of today’s propulsion technology sits in this category. To further subdivide, we merely have to ask the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do we get the oxygen required for our combustion reaction? If the answer is from the atmosphere, then we have a jet engine. But if do not have this option and must carry all our oxygen onboard, then we have a rocket engine. Due to this constraint, rocket engines are less efficient than jet engines, but that hasn’t stopped us from building them bigger!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;jet-engines&quot;&gt;Jet Engines&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jet engines have become the backbone of today’s aviation industry. Unlike their rocket counterparts, planes have the luxury of flying through the atmosphere, which is full of useful oxygen for combustion reactions. Thus, Jet engines are referred to as “air-breathing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic jet engine consists of 5 stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inlet - slows down incoming air and deals with shockwaves if there’s any&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compressor - draws in air and slows it down while raising the pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combustion - adds energy to incoming fluid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turbine - collect some power from the flow to drive the compressor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nozzle - converts thermal energy into kinetic energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jet engines that follow this model which includes a turbine are known as &lt;strong&gt;Turbojets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turbojet&lt;/strong&gt; - a nozzle based propulsion system, that uses deflagration combustion, where oyxgen for the combustion reaction is pulled from the environment. In order to pressurize air, a compressor is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in our quest to move faster, we must cross over into supersonic speeds. In this realm of super fast fluid flow, shocks become an important problem. Luckily, we have a solution: ramjets and scramjets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramjets&lt;/strong&gt; - these function like a turbojet, but rely on the incredibly fast forward speed of the vehicle to compress incoming air. Thus, ramjets do away with the compressor and turbine stages, but do not generate any thrust on their own unless the vehicle is already moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scramjets&lt;/strong&gt; - short for supersonic combustion ramjet. Virtually identical in functionality to a ramjet but instead of slowing the flow down to supsonic speeds for combustion, scarmjets keep the flow supersonic. This makes combustion very complicated but at &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; high speeds, slowing incoming air down all the way just isn’t very efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;rocket-engines&quot;&gt;Rocket Engines&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, we have rockets. Rockets engines are a nozzle based propulsion system, that relies on a deflagration combustion reactions to add thermal energy to a fluid. Additionally, rockets carry their own oxidizer onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we subdivide rocket engines? Well how about by the way in which propellent is stored? If both fuel and oxidizer and mixed together in a solid, that’s a solid rocket motor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solid rocket motor&lt;/strong&gt; - not all that different from an explosive, but simple, cheap, and reliable. These things are what you find in hobby rockets, but can be scaled up to power things like the space shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If (fuel xor oxidizer == liquid), then we have a hybrid rocket engine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid rocket motor&lt;/strong&gt; - these allow for more control than a solid rocket motor, but are a step up in complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if both the fuel and oxidizer are liquid, then we have a liquid rocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;liquid-rockets&quot;&gt;Liquid Rockets&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever seen a big rocket launch, most likely it was a liquid rocket. The Falcon 9, Atlas, Delta, and Space Shuttle are all examples. The primary advantage of these systems is their control. A series of pumps and valves moderate the flow of both oxidizer and fuel into the combustion chamber, thus allowing for operators on the ground to control the thrust. This is a necessary component if you want to attempt manuevers like propulsively landing your rocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquid rockets are further classified by the way in which propellent is fed into the combustion chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pumps&lt;/strong&gt; are a common way and provide a nice amount of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pump-fed systems&lt;/strong&gt; are classified into open loop systems, and closed loop systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure&lt;/strong&gt; can also be used to push propellent along the lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure-fed systems&lt;/strong&gt; are classified based on the source of pressure. Some propellents automatically sublimate and create pressure. These systems are autogenous. Alternatively, a third gas (usually a non-reactive nobel gas) can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short addendum to the rockets category is &lt;strong&gt;monopropellant&lt;/strong&gt; engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopropellant engine&lt;/strong&gt; - these do not technically use combustion, but instead rely on an incredibly exothermic chemical decomposition reaction. Hydrazine (NH4) is a popular choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! If you’ve followed along all this way, we’ve gone over about 20 different propulsion systems, ranging from tiny electrosprays to enormous liquid rocket engines. Hopefully you’ve gained a better understanding for the fundamental principles that drive propulsion technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think roadmaps like this are important for visualizing gaps (now there’s a loaded systems engineering word for ya) in our research and development. A question like “what propulsive technologies are we missing?” is much more difficult to answer comprehensively than something like “how can we add heat to a fluid?”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Electric Propulsion</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//electric/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//electric</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Electric propulsion (EP) is, you guessed it, all about electric propulsion. This includes: ion thrusters, hall thrusters, resistojets, arcjets, and electrosprays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, anything battery powered is also frequently called &lt;em&gt;electric propulsion&lt;/em&gt;, but the underlying mechanism of thrust generation in these cases is often a propeller, and that’s certainly an aerodynamics problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worth mentioning while we’re here: propulsion systems are never independent of the entire vehicle. It turns out, the power/fuel demand greatly impacts the design. Sizing appropriate solar arrays for an EP spacecraft, or sizing fuel tanks for a rocket are challenges in their own right, so we’ll limit out scope in this post to analyzing thruster performance only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thrust-to-power-ratio&quot;&gt;Thrust to Power Ratio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applicable to all EP systems. Note that as Isp improves, the thrust per unit power decreases. In the limit of very high Isp, the system is very efficient with propellant, but there is also no thrust being generated.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{T}{P}=\frac{2\eta}{U_{ex}}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thrust&quot;&gt;Thrust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derived from a simple statement of conservation of momentum.
\(T=\ \dot{m}U_{ex}\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;specific-impulse&quot;&gt;Specific Impulse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific impulse is defined with the following equation. In practice, the Isp is found not by measuring exhaust velocity, but rather by measuring thrust and flow rate.&lt;/p&gt;

\[I_{sp}=\frac{T}{\dot{m}g_o}=\frac{U_{ex}}{g_o}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-of-flight&quot;&gt;Time of Flight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that the rocket equation is expressed as:
\(∆V=U_{exhaust}\log{m_initial/m_final}\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving the above in terms of the mass of propellent (the difference between the final and initial mass) we get the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;

\[m_{propellent}=m_{final}\ (e∆VUex-1)\]

&lt;p&gt;The thrust time will be equal to the mass of propellent divided by the mass flow rate. The mass flow rate can be expressed in terms of the thrust and exhaust velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\dot{m}U_{ex}=T\]

\[\Delta t=\ \frac{m_{initial}U_{ex}}{T}e∆VUex-1\]

&lt;p&gt;Note that for electric propulsion systems, thrust scales directly with the power input, according to the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{T}{P}=\frac{2\eta}{U_{ex}}\]

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the time of flight equation becomes:&lt;/p&gt;

\[∆t= (mpayload+αP)Uex22ηPe∆VUex-1\]

&lt;p&gt;Where α is defined as the power density, in units of [weight/power]. We see that thrust time trades directly with power input. For a known thrust time and power, there is an optimum Isp which will minimize launch mass. This is because at low specific impulse, there is a large propellant penalty, but at high specific impulse, there is a large power system mass penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

\[m_{initial}=\frac{2\Delta t\eta m_{pl}e^{\Delta V/U}}{2\Delta t\eta+\alpha U^2\left(1-e^{\Delta V/U}\right)}\]

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resistojets&quot;&gt;Resistojets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, this type of thruster uses a resistive heating element to add energy to a propellent, which is then expanded through a nozzle. Through an energy balance, we can find an expression for the thrust output. Note the efficiency terms.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{1}{2}\frac{T}{\dot{m}}=\eta P_{in}\]

\[\frac{T^2}{P_{in}}=2\eta\dot{m}\]

\[\eta=\eta_f\eta_n\eta_h\eta_d\]

&lt;p&gt;The power going into the propellant directly goes into raising the enthalpy of the propellant. We note here that enthalpy is a function of the temperature, and in most scenarios, is just equal to the specific heat times the temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\eta_hP_{in}=\dot{m}h\left(T_c\right)\]

\[h=c_pT\]

&lt;p&gt;Using all the above relationship, we can express the exhaust velocity as a function of the chamber temperature and specific heat of the gas.&lt;/p&gt;

\[U_{ex}=\sqrt{2c_pT_c\eta_f\eta_n\eta_d}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;frozen-flow-efficiency&quot;&gt;Frozen Flow Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This efficiency term is a measure of how well the internal energy of the gas is converted into directed potential energy. In an ideal case, he would be equal to zero, indicating that 100% of the internal energy has been converted into kinetic energy. In reality, not all the energy can be recovered. In EP systems particularly, dissociation of the propellant due to high temperatures can often lead to high frozen flow losses. (c) refers to the enthalpy in the chamber, and (e) refers to the enthalpy at the exit plane.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\eta_f=\frac{h_c-h_e}{h_c}\]

&lt;p&gt;To improve the frozen flow efficiency, one can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase length of the nozzle (increased heat loss to the walls generally outweighs improved frozen flow efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase pressure (although this increases engine mass)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gases with lower specific heat have better recombination, at the expense of lower enthalpy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heater-efficiency&quot;&gt;Heater Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A measure of how much power input to the heating chamber is actually used towards raising the temperature of the propellant.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\eta_h=\frac{heat\ added\ to\ propellant}{power\ supplied}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;divergence-efficiency&quot;&gt;Divergence Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decreased effective thrust due to radial velocity component of exhaust plume.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\eta_D={cos}^2\theta=\left[\frac{\int{\cos(\theta)d\dot{m}}}{\int{d\dot{m}}}\right]^2\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nozzle-efficiency&quot;&gt;Nozzle Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viscous and thermal losses of propellant internal energy to the nozzle and chamber walls. Q dot here is the rate of energy loss to the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\eta_n=\frac{h_c-h_e-\frac{\dot{Q}}{\dot{m}}}{h_c-h_e}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enthalpy&quot;&gt;Enthalpy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific enthalpy scales with relation to the available energy storage modes, including translational, vibrational, rotational, and dissociative modes. (m) is the molecule mass of a propellent molecule. We’ve assumed that no ionization occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

\[h=\ \frac{k_bT}{m}\left[\frac{5}{2}\left(2-\alpha_2\right)+\beta_r\alpha_2+\beta_r\alpha_2+\frac{(1-\alpha_2)\varepsilon_D}{k_bT}\right]\]

\[\alpha_2+\frac{1}{2}\alpha_1=1\]

\[\alpha_2=fraction\ of\ molecules\ not\ dissociated\]

\[\alpha_1=2 * fraction\ of\ molecules\ that\ have\ dissociated\]

\[\varepsilon_D=dissociation\ energy\]

\[k_b=boltzman\ constant\]

\[\beta_r=percent\ of\ molecules\ which\ have\ this\ energy\ mode\]

&lt;p&gt;Note that for monoatomic molecules, there cannot be rotational or vibrational modes of energy storage. Thus, the enthalpy for a monoatomic molecule reduces to:&lt;/p&gt;

\[h=\ \frac{k_bT}{m}\left[\frac{5}{2}\right]\]

&lt;p&gt;Important result is that dissociation increases entropy, but only if molecules can recombine. If the nozzle length is too short, some dissociated molecules do not recombine to release usable energy in time before they are expelled out the nozzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;arcjets&quot;&gt;Arcjets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar in concept to resistojets, but the propellant acts like a resistor. A typical Arcjets layout is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/arcjet.png&quot; alt=&quot;arcjet&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power absorbed by the gas is a function of its resistance and the current passed through it. The resistance can be found with the following equations:&lt;/p&gt;

\[R=\eta\left(\frac{L}{A}\right)=\frac{m_eV_c}{n_eq^2}\left(\frac{L}{A}\right)\]

\[V_c=\ V_{Te}n_n\sigma\]

\[V_{Te}=\sqrt{\frac{k_bT_e}{m_e}}\]

\[\lambda=\frac{1}{n_n\sigma}\]

&lt;p&gt;Term Definitions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;L – length of the chamber&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A – nozzle throat area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vc – electron/neutral collision frequency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VTe – thermal velocity of electrons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;me – mass of an electron&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;σ – cross section of molecule (πr2)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ne – electron density&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nn – neutral density&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;q – fundamental charge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kb – Boltzmann constant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arcjets are still limited in efficiency by the material at the wall. There is however, a significant temperature drop-off from the centerline to the wall, which can be expressed with the following differential equation (where K is the thermal conductivity [W/Km]):&lt;/p&gt;

\[\left(\frac{I}{A}\right)^2\eta=-\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left[rK\frac{dT}{dr}\right]\]

&lt;p&gt;Convection, and radiation have been ignored in the above relationship. It has also assumed that the power into the propellant has been evenly distributed throughout the volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the relationship of exhaust velocity to Pin for an arcjet can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{1}{2}\dot{m}{U_{ex}}^2=\eta\int\rho\left(\vec{u}\bullet\hat{n}\right)h\left(T\right)dA&amp;lt;\eta h(T_c)\dot{m}\]

&lt;p&gt;Where \( T_c \) refers to the temperature long the centerline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;derivation-of-gas-resistivity&quot;&gt;Derivation of Gas Resistivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begin by assuming some electric field, spanning some gap populated with neutral molecules. The acceleration of electrons in that field can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;

\[m_e\frac{dV}{dT}=-q\vec{E}\]

&lt;p&gt;In between collisions with the neutrals, the electron is accelerated by the electric field. The increase in velocity is found by integrating the above equation. In this case, Δt is the time in between collisions.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\vec{V_f}=-\frac{qE}{m_e}∆t+Vi\]

&lt;p&gt;We assume that velocity added by the electric field is negligible compared to the thermal velocity of electrons, which allows us to write:&lt;/p&gt;

\[∆t=1Vc≅λVTe\]

&lt;p&gt;The average velocity of electrons in the gap is then:&lt;/p&gt;

\[Average\ V_f=\frac{1}{N}\sum{-\frac{qE\Delta t}{m_e}}+\frac{1}{N}\sum V_i=-\frac{qE}{m_eV_c}\]

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gridded-ion-thruster&quot;&gt;Gridded Ion Thruster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These thrusters no longer rely on heating of a propellant. Instead, ions are directly accelerated through an electrostatic potential. Note that like a thermal system, kinetic energy of the propellant increase as the potential energy goes down. In this case, potential energy is in the form of an electrostatic potential.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{1}{2}mU^2=q(V_{in}-V_{out})\]

\[U_{ex}=\sqrt{\frac{2q}{M}V_o}\]

\[T=\dot{m}U_{ex}=\frac{I_B}{q}M_{Xe}\sqrt{\frac{2q}{M_{Xe}}V_o}\]

&lt;p&gt;There are few important constraints that affect how we want to design the electric potential profile of the thruster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We want a large potential drop from the positive grid to the negative grid to accelerate our ions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We want to attract positively charged ions to the positive grid while repelling electrons. This is achieved by keeping the chamber at a slightly higher potential than the positive grid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We do not want electrons in the exhaust plume to be pulled back into the chamber, so we offset the entire thruster, (i.e. the negative grid is at a lower potential than the exhaust, thus repelling electrons).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, there are three important components to a gridded ion thruster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accelerator Grid (A positive and negative grid, sometimes a third one)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ion Production chamber&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neutralizing Electron Gun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An electrical diagram is shown below, along with a map of the electric potential throughout the thruster. A minimum of 3 independent power supplies are required in order to achieve the desired mapping of potentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/git.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gridded Ion Thruster&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of a gridded ion system can be calculated with an energy balance as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\eta=\frac{T^2}{2\dot{m}P_{in}}\]

\[\eta=\frac{M}{\dot{m}}\frac{V_B}{q}\frac{I_B^2{cos}^2\theta}{P_D+V_BI_B}=\eta_D\eta_m\eta_e\]

\[\eta_D={cos}^2\theta\]

\[\eta_m=\frac{M}{\dot{m}}\frac{I_B}{q}\]

\[\eta_E=\frac{V_BI_B}{P_D+V_BI_B}\]

&lt;p&gt;Where, B refers to beam and D refers to the discharge. The three main types of efficiency are the discharge efficiency, mass utilization efficiency (how much of mass flowrate is successfully accelerated), and the electrical efficiency (power put into the ionization and constraining ions vs energy of successfully accelerated ions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/gitPotential.png&quot; alt=&quot;GIT Potential&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;charge-exchange-event&quot;&gt;Charge Exchange Event&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An event in which an accelerated ion impacts a neutral molecule in the exhaust plume. The decelerated ion is drawn back into to the potential well that was preventing electron backflow. This leads to sputtering and degrading of the negative grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution is to install a third grid, which creates a positive electric potential which repels ions. It unfortunately does attract electrons, but electrons are stopped by the negative grid from passing further into the thruster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-charge-limited-thrust-density&quot;&gt;Space Charge Limited Thrust Density&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a limit to the amount of current which can be passed through the grids before the current itself cancels the electric field. This limit is defined with the Child-Langmuir Law.&lt;/p&gt;

\[J=\frac{4\varepsilon_o}{9}\sqrt{\frac{2q}{m_{Xe}}}\frac{V^{3/2}}{d^2}\]

&lt;p&gt;This is the primary limiter of thrust density for all Gridded Ion Thrusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quasi-neutrality&quot;&gt;Quasi-Neutrality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the plasma chamber of a gridded ion thruster, quasi-neutrality is maintained (i.e. the electron density and ion density is the same). This is no longer true between the grids (by design since electrons are not allowed to enter). Quasi-neutrality is also maintained everywhere within a Hall thruster. This idea is important because space charge effects cannot apply to a quasi-neutral plasma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hall-thrusters&quot;&gt;Hall Thrusters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hall thrusters are a form of electromagnetic propulsion which rely on the combination of an electric field and magnetic field. They have higher thrust densities than gridded ion thrusters, but lower efficiency and specific impulse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propellent, typically Xenon, is injected into the chamber. They collide with electrons caught in the hall drift and are ionized. The ions are then accelerated out by the electric field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the device is an electrostatic accelerator, thrust is actually produced magnetically through the hall current. The hall current generates a magnetic field, which interacts with the current flowing in the solenoids (which generate the magnetic field that causes the hall current in the first place) to generate thrust. So, while the thruster can be analyzed with momentum conservation, the mechanism of force generation is not directly due to the acceleration of ions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(I_D\) 	Discharge Current&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(I_B\)	Beam Current&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(I_{ec}\)	Cathode Discharge Current&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discharge current represents the total current emitted from the cathode. A portion will go towards neutralizing the exhaust and is thus equal to the beam current. Another portion falls into the annulus of the thruster. Electrons which fall into the annulus become trapped in the Hall Effect, providing the source of ionization and thrust. Overtime, electrons will collide with neutrals, ionizing them. However, this leads to them slowly escaping the Hall Effect and eventually falling into the anode (along the electric potential line). The current of electrons escaping the hall current and reaching the anode (Iec) is a loss mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

\[I_D=I_B+I_{ec}\]

&lt;p&gt;We can define a similar setup for the voltage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(V_D\) 	Discharge Voltage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(V_o\)	Beam Voltage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(V_c\)	Cathode Offset Voltage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the current, a portion of the total discharge voltage goes towards extracting electrons from the cathode, instead of accelerating ions in the beam. This value is typically small (20 V, compared to a 300 V discharge voltage).&lt;/p&gt;

\[V_D=V_o+V_c\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;larmor-precession&quot;&gt;Larmor Precession&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charged particles subject to a magnetic field experience a phenomenon known as Larmor precession. This is a spiraling motion, azimuthally around the axis of the magnetic field. Recall that Maxwell’s equation states:&lt;/p&gt;

\[F=q(V\times B)\]

&lt;p&gt;The radius of this precession is known as the Larmor radius/Gryoradius, and the frequency is known as the Cyclotron frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/LarmorProcession.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;larmorPrecesession&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[\omega_{cyclotron}=\frac{qB}{m}\]

\[r_{Larmor}=\frac{mv_\bot}{qB}\]

&lt;p&gt;Due to the mass difference, ions have a much larger Larmor radius than electrons. This means that electron motion is very tightly bound by the magnetic field lines, but ions are mostly free to follow the direction of electric potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hall-effect&quot;&gt;Hall Effect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When subject to perpendicular E and B fields, charged particles will experience azimuthal drift in the direction perpendicular to both the E and B field. The drift velocity can be found as:&lt;/p&gt;

\[v_\theta=\frac{E\times B}{B^2}\]

&lt;p&gt;This leads the creation of the Hall Current, which is the current due to charged particles (in our case only electrons) drifting in the azimuthal direction within the thruster. Ions also experience drift, but due to their larger mass are not as affected.&lt;/p&gt;

\[J_{hall}=qn_ev_\theta\]

&lt;p&gt;The net equation of motion for a charged particle inside an E x B field is the combination of the E x B drift term (the Hall Effect), and the Larmor precession. The initial perpendicular velocity and phase can be given, but in our case, we are not as interested in the specific motion of a single electron as the general bulk motion giving rise to the hall current.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\vec{v}=-\frac{E_o}{B_o}\hat{y}+v_\bot[\cos{\left(\omega_{ce}t+\theta\right)}\hat{x}+\sin(\omega_{ce}t+\theta)\hat{y}]\]

\[J_{hall}=qn_e\frac{E_o}{B_o}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hall-thruster-efficiency&quot;&gt;Hall Thruster Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hall thruster efficiency decreases with thruster size. This is due to the ratio of surface area to volume (electrons colliding with the SA is a loss). Current systems can achieve about 75% efficiency, and this appears to be an empirical limit. We define the following efficiency terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Current utilization (losses due to differences between beam and discharge current). This is the dominate form of loss (~75%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charge utilization (losses due to non-singly charged ions) (~95-97%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Divergence efficiency (~93-95%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mass utilization (~93-99%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Voltage utilization (losses due to applied voltage potential not being equal to potential drop of ions as they are accelerated) (~95%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Electrical efficiency (~99%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efficiencies can be calculated using the following expressions:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\eta_B=\frac{I_B}{I_D}\]

\[\eta_v=\frac{V_o}{V_D}\]

\[\eta_e=\frac{V_DI_D}{V_DI_D+P_{magnets}}\]

\[\eta_m=\frac{\dot{m}_{beam}} {\dot{m}_{injected}}\]

\[\eta_D={cos}^2(\theta)\]

&lt;p&gt;The total power efficiency is the product of the current and voltage utilization efficiency. As mentioned, the major loss mechanism in Hall thrusters is the flow of electrons flowing into the anode. This current is captured by the Iec term. This loss mechanism can be reduced by increasing the strength of the magnetic field (and hence electron confinement by the hall effect). See Hall Parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hall-parameter&quot;&gt;Hall Parameter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hall parameter is the ratio of cyclotron frequency to collision frequency. At higher values, the rate of electron-neutral collisions is decreased, hall current increases, and efficiency improves (due to fewer losses to the anode). The hall parameter increases with increasing magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\Omega=\frac{\omega_{cyclotron}}{v_c}\]

&lt;p&gt;In general, a higher hall parameter is desirable. However, at very large values, the magnetic field becomes sufficiently large that ions are also trapped by the Hall drift and thrust decreases to zero. Current empirical cap is around 150.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hall-thruster-erosion&quot;&gt;Hall Thruster Erosion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an issue that has been largely overcome due to the technology of magnetic shielding. Magnetic field lines are configured such that charged particles following the field lines do not collide with the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;electrosprays&quot;&gt;Electrosprays&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrosprays rely on the acceleration of charged ionic fluid with an electrostatic field. When exposed to an electrostatic potential, an ionic liquid will form into a Taylor Cone and droplets will be emitted from the tip of the cone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrosprays are further subdivided system which emit droplets (colloids) and system which emit ion (field emission thruster, or FEEP). Colloid thruster use ionic liquids, while some FEEP systems use liquid metals. Due to the high mass of droplets, colloid thrusters product greater thrust, at the loss of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;colloid-thrusters&quot;&gt;Colloid Thrusters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charged propellant droplets have some average charge to mass ratio that is a function of the volume flow rate.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{q}{m}= \frac{f(\varepsilon)}{\rho} (\frac{\gamma K}{\varepsilon Q})^{\frac{1}{2}}\]

&lt;p&gt;Where f(ε) is an empirical scaling function that is equal to approximately 18 for values of (ε) greater than 40. K is the conductivity, Q is the volume flow rate, ε is the permittivity of the liquid, \gamma is the surface tension, and \rho is the density. The above can be used to solve for thrust as a function of the specific impulse and applied voltage.&lt;/p&gt;

\[T=\frac{f(\varepsilon )^2}{\rho (g_o Isp)^3}(\frac{\gamma K}{\varepsilon})4{V_o}^2\]

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we find that that thrust scales with the square of voltage, but inversely with the cube of Isp. At high values of specific impulse, an extremely large voltage is required to produce even small amounts of thrust. Thus electrosprays must be built with multiple emission sites (typically on the order of 100-1000) to reach thrust levels comparable to gridded ion or hall thrusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, this also means that we can just keep adding emission sites to increase the thrust (like increasing the number of thrusters). At this scale, doing so adds relatively little support equipment mass.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fundamentals of Dynamics</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//fundamentalsDynamics/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//dynamicsFundamentals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In dynamics, the goal is to predict the position, velocity, and acceleration of rigid bodies as a function of time through the use of Newton’s second law, F=ma. While the basic principle is simple, the key challenge of dynamics involves the definition of reference frames, vectors, and their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note that F = ma is not the only way to solve dynamics problems! In the late 1700’s, Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced an energy conservation strategy, known today as the Euler-Lagrange Equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first idea to introduce is that of a reference frame. References frames are often attached to a rigid body, but this is not required. There are two properties to consider when relating two reference frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Position vector from the origin of one frame to another.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rotation from one frame to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, one may be tempted to take the derivative of the two previous quantities. However, this must be done carefully. This is because there are very specific definitions of angular velocity and velocity. Taking the derivative is non-trivial! We are in the world of 3-dimensions now, so no more thinking in terms of scalars!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kinematics&quot;&gt;Kinematics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subset of dynamics, where forces are neglected, and we focus instead on the motion of points and rigid bodies over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;representation-of-rotations&quot;&gt;Representation of Rotations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we will see, an angular velocity is one easy way to define the rotation of one frame with respect to another. The angular velocity is defined using a vector and an angle. However, there are other ways to define the rotation. These methods are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Rotation Matrix&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Euler Angle Rotations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Axis-angle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quaternions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each method technically encapsulates all the information you need, and for obvious reasons, some are more useful than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vectors&quot;&gt;Vectors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of dynamics, a vector is defined as a construct of direction and magnitude, but do not have an associated location, unless otherwise specified to be a &lt;strong&gt;position vector&lt;/strong&gt;. Vectors are typically defined through the use of orthonormal basis vectors. A set of basis vectors is said to span some space/range. (see math section for a more detailed discussion of vectors spaces and linear algebra).&lt;/p&gt;

\[V=\sum V_i\alpha_i\]

&lt;p&gt;Where the values of \(\alpha_i\) are the basis vectors which are defined for a given problem and reference frame, and \(V_i\) are called the measure numbers (these are scalars).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//fluidFundamentals/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//fluidFundamentals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To be clear, when we talk about fluid mechanics, we aren’t just talking about the second state of matter (liquid \(\subset\) fluid). It honestly would make a lot more sense if we called it “flow mechanics”, but too many textbooks have been printed now to change that. In any case, we’re stuck with the term fluid mechanics, so that’s what we’ll be working with here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we’ll be dealing with so called &lt;strong&gt;Newtonion fluids&lt;/strong&gt;. Non-newtonian fluids are weird, and I haven’t studied them, so there won’t be anything about them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, while we’re laying down the groundwork here, it’s important to mention that classic fluid mechanics is treated as a subset of continuum mechanics. This is known as an engineering model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Continuums are characterized by the existence of shear, and by being continuous (duh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But watch out! When the density is really low, (such as in space) the continuum assumption falls apart, at which point we must switch over to modelcular dynamics. This is an important rule to remember generally speaking. Each equation we develop comes with it’s own set of assumptions that must be true or else our equation isn’t valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;newtonian-fluid&quot;&gt;Newtonian Fluid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Newtonian fluid has a linear relationship between stress and strain rate. Non-newtonian fluids have non-linear relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fundamentals&quot;&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, we want to find the following properties as a function of location and time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pressure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Temperature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Density&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Velocity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acceleration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above information, we can find things like lift, drag, work, &amp;amp; heat transfer (all very important for engineering applications). In a complete model, all 5 of these properties are closely related. Not surprisingly, it’s also difficult to solve for all 5 properties at once. Thus, the subject of fluid mechanics is further broken up into categories based on assumptions and simplifications. These assumptions allow us to make certain variables independent of other variables. The three most important “categories” are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incompressible vs Compressible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inviscid vs Viscid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laminar vs Turbulent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any combinations of the above labels are technically possible. Here are a few examples, and the respective sub-domains you get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compressible, Inviscid, Laminar = Shocks, expansion waves, acoustic waves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compressible, Viscid, Turbulent = Turbulent boundary layers, supersonic wakes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compressible, Viscid, Laminar = Hypersonic boundary layers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incompressible, Inviscid, Laminar = Potential flow theory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incompressible, Viscid, Laminar = Creeping flow, boundary layer theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve problems in fluid mechanics, we can borrow laws and theories that traditionally fall under other disciplines. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thermodynamics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conservation Equations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gas Laws&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continuum Mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can make assumptions which are imposed as additional contraints. Common assumptions come from thermodynamics: isentropic, isobaric, isochoric, isothermal, steady, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;viscosity&quot;&gt;Viscosity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The viscosity of a fluid $\mu$ defines the relationship between stress and strain. In most cases, we assume that the fluid is a Newtonian Fluid, meaning its stress and strain are related linearly. Here it is in two dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau=\mu\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\right)\]

\[Friction\ Force=\mu\nabla^2\vec{V}=\nabla\tau\]

&lt;p&gt;We can also define the second coefficient of viscosity as λ.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\xi=\lambda+\frac{2}{3}\mu\]

   <title>Kinematics</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//kinematics/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//kinematics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A subset of dynamics, where forces are neglected, and we focus instead on the motion of points and rigid bodies over time. At the core of this topic are a series of rules about positions, velocities, accelerations, and how to find them amid a potentially messy system of reference frames and motion constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;derivatives&quot;&gt;Derivatives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of 3D dynamics, derivatives get complicated. This is largely due to reference frames. We’ll indicate a vector’s reference frame with a prescript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, \({}^A V \) indicates that the vector V is defined with respect to reference frame A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;derivative-of-a-vector&quot;&gt;Derivative of a Vector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The derivative of a vector must always be defined with respect to some reference frame. Given a reference frame A, and basis vectors \(\alpha_i\), and measure numbers \(V_i\), the derivative of vector V in frame A is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A\frac{dV}{dt}=\sum\frac{dV_i}{dx}\alpha_i\]

&lt;p&gt;Thus, one way to take the derivative of vector V is to express the vector in terms of the A basis vectors first, and then derive the measure numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;angular-velocity&quot;&gt;Angular Velocity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The angular velocity is defined as a vector function such that the cross of it with any vector fixed in the frame yields the derivative of that vector in a new frame. Let’s break this down a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define a world frame &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;, and local frame &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define a vector \(b_1\), that is fixed in &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;, and defined in &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; (understand the difference between fixed in &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; vs defined in &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An angular velocity term relates the original vector defined in B, to it’s velocity defined in A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the angular velocity describes the rotation of one frame in another.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A \omega^B \times V= {}^A \frac{dV}{dt}\]

&lt;p&gt;Where the the above notation indicates that \(\omega\) is the angular velocity of frame B defined in frame A.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A \omega^B = b_1 (\dot{b_2} \bullet b_3 )+ b_2 (\dot{b_3} \bullet b_1 )+b_3 (\dot{b_1}\bullet b_2)\]

&lt;p&gt;This is a convenient tool for finding the derivative of a vector without first doing a complex change of reference frame calculation. Angular velocities can be added linearly. That is:&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A\omega^D=\ {}^A\omega^B + {}^B\omega^C + {}^C\omega^D\]

&lt;p&gt;Angular velocities can also be taken in inverse by applying a negative value in front:&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A\omega^B=\ - {}^B\omega^A\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rules-about-derivatives&quot;&gt;Rules about Derivatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few rules to keep in mind when taking derivatives of vectors. First, it is that the order of differentiation matters when taking a double differential. That is to say,&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^B \frac{d}{dt}\left({}^A \frac{d}{dt}V\right)\neq {}^A\frac{d}{dt}\left({}^B\frac{d}{dt}V\right)\]

&lt;p&gt;Some other rules are shown below for differentiation of sums and products&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Derivatives of a sum are distributed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[{}^A\frac{d}{dt}\left(V_1+V_2\right)=\ {}^A\frac{d}{dt}V_1+{}^A\frac{d}{dt}V_2\]

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can pull out a scalar multiplier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[{}^A\frac{d}{dt}\left({sV}_1\right)=\ {}^A\frac{ds}{dt}V_1+s{}^A\frac{d}{dt}V_1\]

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the product rule when dealing with vector dot products (also known as an inner product).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[{}^A\frac{d}{dt}\left(V\bullet W\right)=\ {}^A\frac{dV}{dt}\bullet W+V\bullet{}^A\frac{dW}{dt}\]

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also use the product rule with dealing with vector cross products (a.k.a. outer product), but note the change in operation order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[{}^A\frac{d}{dt}\left(V\times W\right)=\ {}^A\frac{dV}{dt}\times W+{}^A\frac{dW}{dt}\times V\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simple-angular-velocity&quot;&gt;Simple Angular Velocity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a vector (k) fixed in both frame A and frame B over an interval of time, then B is said to have simple angular velocity in A during that time interval. This simplifies the expression of the angular velocity of B in A to:&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A\omega^B=\ \dot{\theta} k\]

&lt;p&gt;Where \( \theta \) is an angle defined around the common axis, and k is a unit vector in the direction of the axis defined in A. This is a more precise way of defining the case where an “axis” of rotation may exist, but note that generally speaking, an axis does not need to exist for us to be able to define an angular velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Euler’s Rotation Theorem states that in three-dimensional space, any displacement of a rigid body such that a point on the rigid body remains fixed, is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis that runs through the fixed point. This leads to the idea of a “group” - a mathematical structure which all rotations must follow. This 3D rotation group is known as SO(3). In matrix representation, this is any orthogonal 3x3 matrix with determinant 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;derivative-in-two-reference-frames&quot;&gt;Derivative in Two Reference Frames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The derivative of the same vector with respect to two different reference frames A and B can be related by the angular velocity of B in A.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A\frac{dV}{dt}=\ {}^B\frac{dV}{dt}+{}^A\omega^B\times V\]

&lt;p&gt;Where V does not have to be a vector fixed in B. Note that if V is fixed in B, the derivative of V with respect to B goes to zero, leaving just the cross product of the angular velocity and V yielding the derivative in A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;angular-acceleration&quot;&gt;Angular Acceleration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The angular acceleration of a vector is defined as the derivative of an angular velocity vector function in &lt;em&gt;any frame&lt;/em&gt;. Note that the frame in which we take the derivative does not matter.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A\alpha^B=\ {}^A\frac{d}{dt} {}^A\omega^B = {}^B\frac{d}{dt} {}^A\omega^B\]

&lt;p&gt;We can prove this second fact by applying the rule of differentiation in two reference frames, noting that a vector crossed by itself is always equal to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A\frac{d\omega}{dt}=\ {}^B\frac{d\omega}{dt}+{}^A\omega^B\times{}^A\omega^B\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-velocity-and-general-acceleration&quot;&gt;General Velocity and General Acceleration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To define general velocity, we need to define a position vector. A position vector must start from a fixed point in the frame of differentiation. Any fixed point can be taken, as long as it is in the frame.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^AV^P=\ {}^A\frac{d}{dt}P^{P/N}\]

&lt;p&gt;The above is an expression for the velocity of point P in the reference frame A, where the vector P goes from point N fixed in A to a point P not fixed in A. The definition of acceleration of point P in frame A is then found by taking the second derivative of the velocity vector.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^Aa^P={}^A\frac{d}{dt}{}^AV^P\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v2pts-and-a2pts&quot;&gt;V2PTS and A2PTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider two points (P and Q) fixed in a rigid body B, that has some angular velocity in frame A. We can relate the velocities of these two points in frame A as:&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^AV^Q= {}^AV ^P+ {}^A \omega^B \times R^{Q/P}\]

&lt;p&gt;Where R is a vector that points to Q from P. Similarly, we can relate the acceleration of these points if we know the angular acceleration of body B in frame A.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^Aa^Q={}^A a^P+{}^A\omega ^B \times ( {}^A\omega ^B \times R^{Q/P})+{}^A \alpha^B \times R^{Q/P}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v1pts-and-a1pts&quot;&gt;V1PTS and A1PTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a point P that has some velocity in frame B. Frame B itself moved with angular velocity in a reference frame A. The velocity and acceleration of point P in frame A is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^AV^P={}^AV^{B_p}+{}^BV^P\]

\[{}^Aa^P={}^Aa^{B_p}+{}^Ba^P+2{}^A\omega^B\times{}^BV^P\]

&lt;p&gt;Where \( B_p \) is defined as a point of B coincident with P at some time, t*. This is convenient because we can define \( B_p \) to be stationary in B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;configuration-constraints&quot;&gt;Configuration Constraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a system of points, where each point is defined by position vector, where each vector has three measure numbers. A constraint configuration constraint is a function of these measure numbers that is equal to zero. Configuration constraints are also known as “holonomic constraints”.&lt;/p&gt;

\[P_1,P_2,\ldots,\ P_n\rightarrow vectors\]

\[f\left(P_{11},\ P_{12},\ P_{13},\ldots,\ P_{n1},\ P_{n2},P_{n3}\right)=0\]

&lt;p&gt;Next, we are going to define what are known as generalized coordinates and speeds. The main objective of this function is to simplify later when we have to define and solve the F = ma equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generalized-coordinates&quot;&gt;Generalized Coordinates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using configuration constraints, we can define a set of (n) generalized coordinates. The total number of generalized coordinates is equal to:&lt;/p&gt;

\[n=3v+6\eta-m\]

&lt;p&gt;Where v is the number of points, \(\eta\) is the number of rigid bodies, and m is the number of configuration constraints we have defined in the original problem. Generalized coordinates are usually defined with the letter q.&lt;/p&gt;

\[q_1,q_2,q_3,\ldots q_n\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generalized-speeds&quot;&gt;Generalized Speeds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generalized speeds are defined as linear combinations of the time derivative of the generalized coordinates. We define these both with the sum notation, and in matrix notation.&lt;/p&gt;

\[u_r= \sum_{s=1}^{n}{Y_{rs}{\dot{q}_s}+Z_r}\ \ \ \ \ \ r=(1,\ \ldots n)\]

\[u=Y\dot{q}+Z\]

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we can also invert the matrix expression to arrive at an expression for the kinematic differential equations as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\dot{q}=Y^{-1}u-Y^{-1}Z\]

&lt;p&gt;Generalized speeds are useful because they give us the flexibility to simplify our expression for velocity. We define as many as are necessary to fully describe the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;motion-constraints&quot;&gt;Motion Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motion constraints can be created by separating the generalized speeds into a series of dependent and independent generalized speeds. We denote the first 1 through p speeds as the independent speeds, and p+1 through n as the dependent speeds. The dependent speeds are linear combinations of the independent speeds. The number of independent speeds, p, is also referred to as the degrees of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

\[u_1,u_2,\ldots,\ u_p,\ u_{p+1},\ldots,\ u_n\]

\[u_r=\ \sum_{s=1}^{P}{A_{rs}u_s+B_r}\ \ \ \ \ r=(p+1,\ \ldots,\ n)\]

&lt;p&gt;Motion constraints are referred to as “non-holonomic constraints”, but this is distinct from the “holonomic” constraints we used to define coordinate constraints (very confusing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;partial-angular-velocities-and-partial-velocities&quot;&gt;Partial Angular Velocities and Partial Velocities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partial angular velocities are defined as those that when multiplied by the generalized speeds produce the original angular velocity expression. Note that there is a remainder term at the end. There are (n) total partial angular velocities. When motion constraints are applied, there are only (p) partial angular velocities – one for every generalized speed.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A\omega^B= [{}^A\omega_1 ^B,\ \ldots,\ {}^A\omega_n^B] \begin{bmatrix}u_1\\\ldots\\u_n\\\end{bmatrix}+w_t\]

\[{}^A\omega^B= [{}^A \tilde{\omega}_1^B,\ \ldots, {}^A \tilde{\omega}_p^B ]  \begin{bmatrix}u_1\\\ldots\\u_p\\\end{bmatrix} + \tilde{w}_t\]

&lt;p&gt;The partial velocities are defined in much the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^AV^B= [{}^AV_1^B,\ \ldots,\ {}^AV_n^B ] \begin{bmatrix}u_1\\\ldots\\u_n\\\end{bmatrix} +V_t\]

\[{}^AV^B= [{}^A \widetilde{V}_1^B,\ \ldots,\ {}^A \widetilde{V}_p^B ] \begin{bmatrix}u_1\\\ldots\\u_p\\\end{bmatrix}+\widetilde{V}_t\]

&lt;p&gt;The partial angular velocities can be derived by using our previous definition of the angular velocity in terms of the basis vectors and their derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

\[{}^A\omega^B=b_1(\dot{b_2}\bullet b_3)+b_2 (\dot{b_3}\bullet b_1 )+b_3 (\dot{b_1}\bullet b_2)\]

\[\frac{}^AdV}{dt}= \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial V}{\partial q_1}&amp;amp;\ldots&amp;amp;\frac{\partial V}{\partial q_s}\\\end{bmatrix} \begin{matrix}{\dot{q}_1\\\ldots\\{\dot{q}_s\\\end{matrix}+\frac{}^A\partial V}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial V}{\partial q}\dot{q}+\frac{}^A\partial V}{\partial t}\]

\[\dot{q}=Wu+X\]

\[{}^A\omega^B=\left[b_1\frac{\partial b_2}{\partial q}\bullet b_3+b_2\frac{\partial b_3}{\partial q}\bullet b_1+b_3\frac{\partial b_1}{\partial q}\bullet b_2\right]\left(Wu+X\right)+\frac{}^A\partial b_1}{\partial t}+\frac{}^A\partial b_2}{\partial t}+\frac{}^A\partial b_3}{\partial t}\]

\[{}^A\omega^B=\left[~\right]Wu+\left[~\right]X+\frac{}^A\partial b_1}{\partial t}+\frac{}^A\partial b_2}{\partial t}+\frac{}^A\partial b_3}{\partial t}\]

&lt;p&gt;We now have an expression for the angular velocity which satisfies the format we’ve already defined for the partial angular velocities. Take care to notice everything that goes into the remainder term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why define partial angular velocities at well? Well, in a full dynamics problem, we’ll frequently encounter a situation in which an applied force causes a resultant acceleration/velocity in one direction, but not in another. Partial velocities allow us to separate each F = ma statement by direction, greatly simplifying each equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;partial-acceleration-and-partial-velocities&quot;&gt;Partial Acceleration and Partial Velocities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to take the projection of accelerations into the partial velocities and see that it connects to the same result in Lagrange’s Method. I will write more when I understand what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Continuum Mechanics</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//continuumMechanics/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//continuumMechanics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the common assumptions we make when working with fluids is that it forms a continuum. The individual atoms of a fluid are assumed to be tightly packed enough that we can approximate the collective molecular interactions. What are these collective molecular interactions? Well, pretty standard stuff actually. We assume that applying a force causes an object to move, or a body to deform. (Technically speaking, that stress is related to strain). And honestly well, that’s kinda it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this assumption is so powerful is because it makes our model &lt;strong&gt;continuous&lt;/strong&gt;. This may seem pretty obvious at a glance, but working with stuff that is continuous is very different from working with stuff that is discrete! The reason as you may already have guessed: derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so what can we do with continuums? Well, how about mass, momentum, and energy conservation? Sounds easy enough. There are two ways to do this: with either a &lt;strong&gt;control mass&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;control volume&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Mass&lt;/strong&gt; We define a body/mass we are interested in and track how its momentum/energy changes over time. (Notice that by definition, the total mass remains constant)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Volume&lt;/strong&gt; We define a region of space, and take into account any mass/momentum/energy which flows in or out of this region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conservation-of-mass&quot;&gt;Conservation of Mass&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as continuity. Time rate of change of mass in the control volume (CV) is equal to the mass flux through the boundary. Or, in differential form, partial derivative of density plus mass flux is zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integral&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint\rho dV=- \iint \rho u \bullet \hat{n} dA\]

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conservative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\bullet\left(\rho u \right)=0\]

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-conservative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\frac{D\rho}{Dt}+\nabla\bullet\left(\rho u \right)=0\]

&lt;p&gt;For (quasi) 1-dimensional steady flow, the mass flow rate can be expressed as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\dot{m}=\rho AV\]

&lt;p&gt;For 2D incompressible flow, we need to account for the velocity in two directions. Note that we assumed incompressibe, which results in the density term dropping out. In this case continuity is also just conservation of volume. It can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conservation-of-momentum&quot;&gt;Conservation of Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time rate of change of momentum in the CV is equal to the advection term plus forces. Or in differential form, partial of momentum with respect to time plus advection term is equal to forces acting on the fluid element. Note that the right side of the equation is the substantial derivative. You may recognize these as the Navier-Stokes equations. Or another way of thinking about it, the Navier-Stokes equations are just a statement momentum conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integral&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint\rho udV=- \iint u \left(\rho u\bullet\hat{n}\right)dA-\iint\left(P\hat{n}\right)dA\]

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conservative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\frac{\partial\rho u}{\partial t}+\left(\nabla\bullet\rho u  \right) u=-\nabla P+\rho g+\nabla\tau+F_{body}\]

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-conservative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\rho\frac{Du}{Dt}=-\nabla P+\rho g+\nabla\tau+F_{body}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conservation-of-energy&quot;&gt;Conservation of Energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time rate of change is equal to advection term plus heat (both volumetrically and through the surface). Note that work done is encapsulated in the P/rho term in the advection integral. Or, the substantial derivative of total enthalpy is equal to time rate of change of pressure (work) and flux of heat. This is also a statement of the 1st law of thermodynamics. (Conservation of Energy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integral&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint{\rho(e+\frac{1}{2}U^2)dV}=-\iint{\rho\left(e+\frac{P}{\rho}+\frac{1}{2}U^2\right)u\bullet\hat{n}dA}+\iiint{\rho\dot{q}dV}-\iint{\dot{q}^n\bullet\hat{n}dA}\]

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conservative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\frac{\partial\rho e}{\partial t}+\nabla\bullet\left(u(\rho e+P)\right)=0\]

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-Conservative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\rho\frac{Dh_o}{Dt}=\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}+\rho\dot{q}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conservative-vs-non-conservative-form&quot;&gt;Conservative vs Non-conservative Form&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative equations are valid over discontinuities in the fluid flow. These mathematical models directly stems from applying conservation of mathematical quantities within a control volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is this related to the idea of a conservative vector field? I’m actually unsure, but I like the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider the case where we take a derivative of a multivariable function. Mathematically, we can expand this derivative with the chain rule, but in doing so, we introduce terms that no longer describe a physical quantity. This is known as the non-conservative form. Most importantly, the non-conservative forms are not valid over discontinuities (i.e. shocks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;euler-equations&quot;&gt;Euler Equations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Euler equations represent conservation of momentum when viscous forces are neglected. This is also associated with the limit as Reynold’s number approaches infinity, and the regime of potential flow theory. In this regime, the no slip boundary condition cannot be applied, instead fluid flow at the wall is always tangential to the wall. The following equations have assumed incompressible flow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cartesian-coordinates&quot;&gt;Cartesian Coordinates&lt;/h4&gt;

\[x:\ \ \ \ \rho\left[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right]=-\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\rho g_x\]

\[y:\ \ \ \ \rho\left[\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}\right]=-\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\rho g_y\]

\[z:\ \ \ \ \rho\left[\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\right]=-\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\rho g_z\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;navier-stokes&quot;&gt;Navier-Stokes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navier-Stokes is a general statement of conservation of momentum. The form presented here includes forces due to pressure, gravity, and viscous forces, but neglects other types of forces. This form has also assumed constant density and viscosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cartesian-coordinates-1&quot;&gt;Cartesian Coordinates&lt;/h4&gt;

\[x:\ \ \ \ \rho\left[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right]=-\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\rho g_x+\mu\left[\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial z^2}\right]\]

\[y:\ \ \ \ \rho\left[\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}\right]=-\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\rho g_y+\mu\left[\frac{\partial^2v}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2v}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2v}{\partial z^2}\right]\]

\[z:\ \ \ \ \rho\left[\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\right]=-\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\rho g_z+\mu\left[\frac{\partial^2w}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2w}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2w}{\partial z^2}\right]\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reynolds-transport-theorem&quot;&gt;Reynold’s Transport Theorem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States that the total time rate of change of an extensive property (B) for a system, depends on the rate of change of the intensive property in the control volume and the flux of that property through the control volume. (Extensive = mass dependent and Intensive = mass independent). In other works, it relates the control mass view of a fluid to the control volume view of a fluid.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{DB_{sys}}{Dt}=\int_{cv}^{cv}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho b)dV+\int_{cs}^{cs}\rho b\left(\vec{v}\bullet\hat{n}\right)ds\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dimensional-analysis&quot;&gt;Dimensional Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can re-write an equation with normalized terms to see the relative magnitude of the different variables. For example, we can introduce a variable, keeping in mind to apply the chain rule when we take a derivative:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\widetilde{x}=\frac{x}{L}\]

\[\frac{\partial\widetilde{x}}{\partial t}=\frac{1}{L}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}\]

&lt;p&gt;We can then make the following substitution into the original expression&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}=L\ast\frac{\partial\widetilde{x}}{\partial t}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bernoulli-equation&quot;&gt;Bernoulli Equation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah who doesn’t love Bernoullli’s equation. It’s so simple. We can derive Bernoulli’s equation from the conservation of energy equations (Euler equations already model adiabatic flow with no viscous forces). Assuming that the flow is also isentropic, steady, and irrotational, Euler’s equations simplify into:&lt;/p&gt;

\[P+\frac{1}{2}\rho U^2+gz=constant\]

&lt;p&gt;Ok, hold on, what are those assumptions again? Let’s just go over those one more time: isentropic, stready, irrotational, adiabatic, inviscid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsteady Bernoulli’s (applicable for irrotational flow). Where the integral of ds is taken along a streamline.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\int\frac{\partial\left|v\right|}{\partial x}ds+\frac{1}{2}v^2+\int\frac{\partial P}{\rho}+gz=F(t)\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2d-potential-flow&quot;&gt;2D Potential Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential flow theory is the theory of inviscid fluid flow. This is also the limit where Reynold’s number tends to infinity. For two-dimensional inviscid flow, we can define the velocity components in terms of two other functions, the stream function and the potential function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Irrotational Velocity Potential $\phi$ 	\(\nabla\times\vec{V}=0\)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incompressible Stream Function $\psi$	\(\nabla\bullet\vec{V}=0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[u=\ \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x}= \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}\]

\[v=\ \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial y}=\ -\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\]

\[u_r=\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial r}=\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\theta}\]

\[u_\theta=\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial r}=\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial\theta}\]

&lt;p&gt;If either of the following is true, we can say that the fluid is both irrotational and incompressible.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\nabla^2\psi=0\]

\[\nabla^2\phi=0\]

&lt;p&gt;In assuming incompressibility, mass continuity reduces into a volume continuity equation, where density has dropped out:&lt;/p&gt;

\[Volume\ Continuity:\ \ \ \nabla\bullet V=\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0\]

   <title>Finally Getting to Dynamics</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//dynamicalEquations/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//dynamicEquations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’re almost ready to write down F = ma, but before that, we need to define what F is (a force), and what ma is (an intertial term).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resultant&quot;&gt;Resultant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resultant is defined as the sum of force vectors. Useful for consolidating a number of forces into a singular equivalent one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bound-vector&quot;&gt;Bound Vector&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bound vector contains a direction, magnitude, or well-defined point. A bound vector may also exist on a line of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moment-about-a-point&quot;&gt;Moment about a Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment about a point due to a bound vector is defined as the cross product of any position vector from the point to the line of action with the force vector. Only defined for bound force vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

\[M^{F/P}=P^{O/P}\times F\]

&lt;p&gt;Where P is the point about which we’d like to take the moment, and O is a point on the line of action. The superscript on M denotes that this is the moment about point P due to a force F.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shift-theorem&quot;&gt;Shift Theorem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we know the moment about a point Q due to a set of forces S with resultant RS, and the position vector from Q to another point P, we can calculate the moment about the point P due to the set of forces RS as:&lt;/p&gt;

\[M^{S/P}=M^{S/Q}+P^{Q/P}\times R^S\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;couples&quot;&gt;Couples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple is a set of vectors whose resultant is zero&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;torque&quot;&gt;Torque&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A torque is the moment of a couple. Torques are constant regardless of the point around which a moment is calculated, due to the nature of couples and how moments are defined. This can be proved via the shift theorem, by simply setting the resultant equal to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generalized-active-force&quot;&gt;Generalized Active Force&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set of generalized active forces are those which are important for determining the dynamics of the problem. The generalized active forces are the set of forces acting on a point dotted with the partial velocities of that point. Recall that there are non-holonomic and holonomic partial velocities, and thus there are likewise non-holonomic and holonomic active forces.&lt;/p&gt;

\[F_r=\sum_{i=1}^{v}{ ( ^A V)^P\bullet R^P}\ \ \ \ \ \ \left(r=1,\ \ldots,\ n\right)\]

\[\widetilde{F_r}=\sum_{i=1}^{v}({}^A \widetilde{V})^P\bullet R^P\ \ \ \ \ \ (r=1,\ \ldots,\ p)\]

&lt;p&gt;These two forces are also related using the definition of non-holonomic partial velocities.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\widetilde{F_r}=F_r+\sum_{s=p+1}^{n}{F_sA_{sr}}\ \ \ \ (r=1,\ \ldots,\ p)\]

&lt;p&gt;Similar to active forces, active torques and moments are defined by dotting with the partial angular velocity of that body.&lt;/p&gt;

\[(F_r)_B=R\bullet{_\ ^A V}^Q+T\bullet{ ^A\omega}_r^B\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-contributing-forces&quot;&gt;Non-contributing Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of forces do not act as part of the set of active forces. There are 4 conditions which allow us to determine which forces are non-contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forces exerted on a system S across smooth surfaces of bodies in contact with S, where smooth implies no friction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internal forces between rigidly connected particles of S.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If B (of S) rolls without slipping on B’ (not a part of S), then all forces exerted by B’ on B are non-contributing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forces exerted between B and B’ (both considered a part of S) are non-contributing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;equivalent-replacement&quot;&gt;Equivalent Replacement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a set of forces acting on a rigid body, we define an equivalent replacement force and torque for the system, where the force is the resultant of all the force vectors and acts through point Q, and P is a position vector from Q to the original point of force application.&lt;/p&gt;

\[R=\sum F\]

\[T=\sum{P\times F}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generalized-inertia-forces&quot;&gt;Generalized Inertia Forces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the equivalent term given to the idea of inertia (mass x acceleration). For particles, they are defined as the partial velocity dotted with the mass times acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

\[F_R^\ast=\sum{V_r^P\bullet R_i^\ast}\]

\[R_i^\ast=-m_i{ ^A a}^P\]

&lt;p&gt;The equation is slightly different for rigid bodies, since we have to take into consideration the contributions due to angular acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

\[F_R^\ast=V_r^P\bullet R_\ ^\ast+{^A\omega}_r^B\bullet T^\ast\]

\[R_i^\ast=-M_\ { ^A a}^B\]

\[T^\ast=-\sum{mr\times}{ ^A \alpha}_r^P\]

&lt;p&gt;Where r is the position vector from body B to point P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dynamical-equations&quot;&gt;Dynamical Equations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamical equations are the equivalent of stating Newton’s second law, F = ma. These equations simply state that the generalized active forces plus the generalized inertia forces is equal to zero. These are generally integrated alongside the kinematic differential equations to find the state variables.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Viscous Flow</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//viscousFlow/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//viscous</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unlike solids, fluids deform constantly under stress (in other words, a fluid &lt;strong&gt;flows&lt;/strong&gt;). How it flows is very much dependent on it’s &lt;strong&gt;viscosity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
Viscosity is to fluids what the modulus of elasticity is to solids. It relates the stress (amount of force) to strain (amount of deformation). Qualitatively, viscosity is a measure of a fluid&apos;s resistence to flowing. Things like honey have a very high viscosity, while air and water have comparatively lower viscosity. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viscous flow then, is the study of how a fluid’s viscosity affects its behavior. Viscous flow covers topics like boundary layers, low-speed flows, and small-scale flows. Coincidentally, the regimes in which viscous forces dominate is often incompressible, but this is not a hard and fast rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;viscosity&quot;&gt;Viscosity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The viscosity of a fluid $\mu$ defines the relationship between stress and strain. In most cases, we assume that the fluid is a Newtonian Fluid, meaning its stress and strain are related linearly. Here it is in two dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau=\mu\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\right)\]

\[Friction\ Force=\mu\nabla^2\vec{V}=\nabla\tau\]

&lt;p&gt;We can also define the second coefficient of viscosity as λ.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\xi=\lambda+\frac{2}{3}\mu\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reynolds-number&quot;&gt;Reynold’s Number&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ratio between viscous forces and inertial forces. The lower the Reynold’s number, the more dominant viscous effects become. The Reynold’s number can also show when a flow transitions from laminar to turbulent flow. Where µ is the dynamic viscosity.&lt;/p&gt;

\[Re=\ \frac{\rho U_\infty L}{\mu}\]

&lt;p&gt;At very low Re, we get the Stokes equations. At very high Re, we get the Euler equations (potential flow theory).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;low-reynolds-number-flow-stokes-flow&quot;&gt;Low Reynold’s Number Flow (Stokes’ Flow)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the exact opposite regime of potential flow theory, in which viscous forces dominate over inertia forces. This is usually associated with low velocity, small scale, or highly viscous flows. Some applications can include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully developed duct flow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flow about immersed bodies (i.e. small particle dynamics)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lubrication theory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flow through porous media (mostly used for civil engineering)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the above assumption (i.e. very low Re), the momentum equation reduces to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\nabla P\approx\mu\nabla^2V\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;low-reynolds-number-flow-over-a-sphere&quot;&gt;Low Reynold’s Number Flow Over a Sphere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By solving stokes equations with the boundary conditions for viscous flow past a sphere, the following stream function can be calculated:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\psi=\frac{1}{4}Ua^2{sin}^2(\theta)\left[\frac{a}{r}-\frac{3r}{a}+\frac{2r^2}{a^2}\right]\]

&lt;p&gt;This can be compared to the stream function found by applying potential flow theory about a sphere:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\psi=\frac{1}{2}Ur^2{sin}^2(\theta)\left[1-\frac{a^3}{r^3}\right]\]

&lt;p&gt;Solving the first equation for shear and pressure drag, we find an expression for the total drag on a sphere in the low Reynold’s number limit:&lt;/p&gt;

\[F=4\pi\mu Ua+2\pi\mu Ua\]

&lt;p&gt;Where the first term is the viscous contribution to drag, and the second term is the pressure contribution to drag. This is normalized by the area and dynamic pressure to find the drag coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

\[C_d=\frac{2F}{\rho U^2\pi a^2}=\frac{24}{Re}\]

&lt;p&gt;This equation underpredicts drag for Reynold’s numbers larger than 1, since separation and wakes introduce greater pressure drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;steady-flow-between-infinite-plates&quot;&gt;Steady Flow between Infinite Plates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another class of problem in which viscous forces dominate. We take the bottom plate to be stationary and assume some steady velocity for the top plate. There can also be a pressure gradient in the direction parallel to the plates. Due to viscosity, the motion of the top plate drags the top layer of fluid along with it. Eventually, some sort of velocity profile develops along this direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the limit that the top plate’s velocity tends to zero we get a Hagen-Poiseuille flow problem (the only that can drive the fluid forward is a pressure gradient). In the limit that the pressure gradient tends to zero we get a Couette flow problem (velocity of the top plate drives flow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general solution of the velocity profile is expressed below. The first equation is the general solution, while the second equation takes the lower wall to be stationary. Where τo is the shear stress at the wall where y=0, and uo is the velocity at the wall where y=0.&lt;/p&gt;

\[u\left(y\right)=\ -\frac{1}{2\mu}\left(-\frac{dP}{dx}\right)y^2+\frac{\tau_o}{\mu}y+u_o\]

\[u\left(y\right)=\ +\frac{1}{2\mu}\left(-\frac{dP}{dx}\right)y(h-y)+U\frac{y}{h}\]

&lt;p&gt;We can also solve for the volume flow rate per unit span by integrating over y.&lt;/p&gt;

\[Q=U\frac{h}{2}+\frac{h^3}{12\mu}\left(-\frac{dP}{dx}\right)\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsteady-flow--infinite-plates&quot;&gt;Unsteady Flow &amp;amp; Infinite Plates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two problems within this category, known as Stokes 1st problem (an impulsively started plate) and Stokes’s 2nd problem (an oscillating plate). Unlike the previous problem, which solves for some steady state condition, these problems deal with transient situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1st-problem&quot;&gt;1st Problem:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stoke’s first problem covers the scenario of an impulsively started plate.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{u(y,t)}{U}=1-\erf{\left(\frac{\eta}{2}\right)}\]

\[\erf{\left(x\right)}=\ \frac{2}{\sqrt\pi}\int_{0}^{x}{e^{-x^2}dx\]

\[\eta=\ \frac{y}{\sqrt{\nu t}}}\]

&lt;p&gt;As time increases, the penetration height will increase. At infinite time, the entire fluid moves with velocity U. The above solution represents a non-dimensionalized solution, where η represents the ratio of position to penetration height scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2nd-problem&quot;&gt;2nd Problem:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motion of the bottom plate is defined as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

\[U\left(t\right)=\ U_o\cos\funcapply(\omega t)\]

&lt;p&gt;The velocity profile above the plate and the stress at the wall can be solved to show the following:&lt;/p&gt;

\[u\left(y,t\right)=U_oe^{-y\sqrt{\sfrac{\omega}{2v}}}cos\left(\omega t-y\sqrt{\sfrac{\omega}{2v}}\right)\]

\[\tau_{wall}=\mu\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=U_o\sqrt{\rho\mu\omega}sin\left(\omega t-\sfrac{\pi}{4}\right)\]

&lt;p&gt;The amplitude of the velocity oscillation decreases with distance from the plate. The ratio of viscosity to frequency determines the penetration height. Note that this ratio also affects a phase lead/lag, which changes with height, represented within the cosine term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pipes&quot;&gt;Pipes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although infinite plates are useful for understanding some of the concepts, they are exactly reflective of real life. What we do see plenty of though, is flow through pipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hagen-poiseuille-circular-pipe-flow-model&quot;&gt;Hagen-Poiseuille Circular Pipe Flow Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressure driven viscous pipe flow. Given L is the length of pipe, Q is the volume flow rate, and some known diameter, we can find the pressure drop. Assumes laminar flow.&lt;/p&gt;

\[∆P= 8μLQπR4\]

\[u\left(r\right)=\ -\frac{1}{4\mu}\left(-\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\right)\left(r_o^2-r^2\right)\]

\[Q=\ \frac{\pi R^4}{8\mu}\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\right)\]

\[C_f=-\frac{\tau_w}{\sfrac{(1}{2})\rho{U_{ave}}^2}=\frac{16}{Re_D}\]

&lt;p&gt;Note that this may not be valid for short pipes, flow near the entrance, and fluids with low viscosity, or flow in a wide pipe. If flow is turbulent, you should switch over to the Darcy-Weisbach approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-realistic-pipe-flow-analysis&quot;&gt;More Realistic Pipe Flow Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For flow (both laminar and turbulent) in a pipe of constant diameter D, we can express the pressure across a given length as:
\(∆PL=fd(12)ρU2D\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where fd is the Darcy friction factor. In the laminar regime, the Darcy Friction factor is equal to \(\sfrac{f_D=64}{Re}\). For turbulent regime values, the friction factor is dependent on the surface roughness. Look up results in a Moody Diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To be inserted, Moody Diagram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More commonly, pressure loss per unit length is replaced with head loss per unit length, S, where head loss is calculated as:
\(∆h= ρg∆P\)&lt;/p&gt;

\[S=∆hL=fd12gV2D\]

&lt;p&gt;Note that the friction factor in the turbulent regime can be calculated with turbulent flow theory and is not simply an empiric fit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;colebrook-interpolation-formula-turbulent--transition-regime&quot;&gt;Colebrook Interpolation Formula (Turbulent &amp;amp; Transition Regime)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provides an easy way to find the friction factor for a given surface roughness and Reynold’s number. \(\Lambda\) here is the friction factor.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{1}{\Lambda^{1/2}}\approx-2.0\log_{10}{\left(\frac{k/D}{3.7}+\frac{2.51}{Re_D\sqrt\Lambda}\right)}-0.8\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hydraulic-diameter&quot;&gt;Hydraulic Diameter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-circular pipes, an equivalent diameter can be found, known as the hydraulic diameter. This allows you to analyze the pipe as if it were circular.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\rho\left(\frac{\partial u_e}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u_e}{\partial x}\right)=-\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\]

&lt;h2 id=&quot;boundary-layers&quot;&gt;Boundary Layers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boundary layers are an incredibly important phenomena arising due to viscous forces. As before, we require that the velocity of the fluid at the wall is equal to the velocity of the wall. Only through BL analysis can we determine things like the lift, drag, and heat flux of objects moving through a fluid (such as a wing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, we’ll focus on laminar boundary layers, however, it is possible for something known as &lt;strong&gt;Boundary Layer Separation&lt;/strong&gt; to occur. When this happens, the fluid ceases to flow past objects in a nice smooth fashion, and trips into turbulent flow. This leads to the topic of &lt;strong&gt;Tubulent Boundary Layer&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a whole other beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2d-boundary-layer-similarity-solutions&quot;&gt;2D Boundary Layer Similarity Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, it is easier to create the following similarity variables, defined using the velocity potential:&lt;/p&gt;

\[u=\ \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}\]

\[v=\ -\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\]

\[\psi\left(y,x\right)=\ U_\infty l\left(x\right)f(\eta)\]

\[\eta=\frac{y}{l(x)}=\frac{y}{x}\sqrt{\frac{Ux}{v}}=\frac{y}{x}\sqrt{Re}\]

\[l\left(x\right)\cong\ \sqrt{\frac{\nu x}{U_\infty}}\]

&lt;p&gt;Here, l(x) is proportional the height of the boundary layer, making η a normalized value for our position in the boundary layer. In addition, f(η) and η are both dimensionless. We should also be able to see that:&lt;/p&gt;

\[f\left(\eta\right)\cong{\psi\]

\[f}^\prime\left(\eta\right)\cong{u,\ v\]

\[f}^{\prime\prime}\left(\eta\right)\cong\tau\]

&lt;p&gt;Re-writing the Prandtl boundary layer equations in terms of our similarity variables, we find an exact solution:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\dddot{f}\left(\eta\right)+f\left(\eta\right)\ddot{f}\left(\eta\right)=0\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;falkner-skan-2d-solution&quot;&gt;Falkner-Skan 2D Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Falkner-Skan solution describes boundary layer flow over a wedge. It is a generalization of the Blasius flat plate boundary layer. Using the same similarity definition as above, the exact solution takes the following form. As with the Blasius solution, a numerical approach is required to find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\dddot{f}+f\ddot{f}+\beta(1+{\dot{f}}^2)=0\]

&lt;p&gt;The velocity in the free stream (i.e. ur in the direction of πB) can be represented by the following equation, as a function of the turning angle:&lt;/p&gt;

\[u_e=Kx^m\]

\[\beta=\frac{2m}{1+m}\]

&lt;p&gt;In the limiting case where B = 0, you get the Blasius flat plate general solution. In the limit that B = 1, you get stagnation point flow. There are tabulated values for the velocity thickness, displacement thickness, momentum thickness, and friction coefficient for a range of B values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blasius-solution-a-2d-flat-plate-1st-order-solution&quot;&gt;Blasius Solution a 2D Flat Plate (1st Order Solution)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blasius solution is an exact differential solution of the boundary layer equations for flow over a flat plate, however, solving it requires a numerical approach.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{\delta}{x}=\frac{5}{\sqrt{Re}}\]

\[\frac{\delta^\ast}{x}=\frac{1.72}{\sqrt{Re}}\]

\[\frac{\theta}{x}=\frac{0.664}{\sqrt{Re}}\]

\[c_f=\frac{0.664}{\sqrt{Re}}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;approximate-solutions-to-2d-boundary-layer&quot;&gt;Approximate Solutions to 2D Boundary Layer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thwaites method uses the Von-Karman integral equations to approximate the boundary layer characteristics. The Von Karman integral relation (steady flow with impermeable wall):&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{c_f}{2}=\frac{d\theta}{dx}+(2+H)\frac{\theta}{U}\frac{dU}{dx}\]

&lt;p&gt;This equation is still an exact relationship. Thwaites method is to make the following approximation: (where P(x) is any generic function of x, and is there to characterize the changes in the velocity profile shape in the boundary layer as a function of the x position)&lt;/p&gt;

\[u(x,y)\approx U\left(x\right)f(\eta,P\left(x\right))\]

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Thwaites method, the following parameter is defined:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\lambda=\left(\frac{\theta}{\delta}\right)^2\frac{\delta^2}{v}\frac{dU_e}{dx}=\frac{\theta^2}{v}\frac{dU_e}{dx}\]

&lt;p&gt;The Von-Karman integral relation can then be re-written, and we see that the terms of the original expression are going to be proportional to the parameter defined above.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{\tau_w\theta}{\mu U}=\frac{U\theta}{v}\frac{d\theta}{dx}+(2+H)\frac{\theta^2U^\prime}{v}\]

\[\frac{\tau_w\theta}{\mu U}\approx Shear\ Factor\ Correlation=S(\lambda)\]

\[H=\ \frac{\delta^\ast}{\theta}\approx Shape\ Factor\ Correlation=H(\lambda)\]

&lt;p&gt;For an external flow problem, the following expression for momentum thickness can be derived:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\theta^2=\frac{0.45v}{U_e^6(x)}\int_{0}^{x}{U_e^5(x\prime)}dx\prime\]

&lt;p&gt;The displacement thickness can be solved by using the following shape factor correlation, as a function of λ.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\delta^\ast=\theta H\left(\lambda\right)\]

\[H\left(\lambda\right)=2+4.14z-83.5z^2+854z^3-3337z^4+4576z^5\]

\[z=0.25-\lambda\]

&lt;p&gt;The laminar boundary layer separates when λ = -0.09.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pressure-gradient-effects&quot;&gt;Pressure Gradient Effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three regimes for the pressure gradient term: favorable (less than zero), adverse (greater than zero), and neutral (equal to zero).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An adverse pressure gradient can cause boundary layer separation. Separation occurs at the point where the wall shear stress is equal to zero (slope of the velocity profile is zero), that is:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau_w=\mu\frac{du}{dy}=0\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;axis-symmetric-3d-boundary-layers&quot;&gt;Axis-Symmetric 3D Boundary Layers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boundary layer equations for an axisymmetric steady flow without swirl can be shown to be equal to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Axisymmetric steady flow without swirl:&lt;/strong&gt; in other words, flow only occurs in the radial or axial direction, and never in azimuth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

\[\frac{\partial(r_ou)}{\partial x}+r_o\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0\]

\[\rho\left(u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)=\rho u_e\frac{\partial u_e}{\partialx}+\mu\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2}\]

&lt;p&gt;The above equations can be transformed into an equivalent set of 2D boundary layer equations with the Mangler Transformation of the coordinate frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fanno-flow&quot;&gt;Fanno Flow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Associated with one dimensional flow with friction. Friction tends to drive flow eventually towards sonic conditions, regardless of whether flow starts out subsonic or supersonic. Given conditions at a point (1) in a pipe, you can solve for the sonic conditions (*). If you then know something about conditions at another point (2), you can use the sonic conditions to backtrack and find all other properties at that second point. In a Fanno flow table, you will usually find the following relations:&lt;/p&gt;

\[M_1\ \ \ \ \ \frac{fL}{D}\ \ \ \ \ \frac{P}{P^\ast}\ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{T}{T^\ast}\ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{P_0}{P_0^\ast}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rayleigh-flow&quot;&gt;Rayleigh Flow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Fanno flow, where heat addition tends to drive flow towards sonic conditions, regardless of initial velocity. Knowing heat input can allow you to find change in total temperature between two points. From there you can backtrack and solve for all other properties at those two points like how you would do it for Fanno flow.&lt;/p&gt;

\[T_{t,2}=\frac{q}{c_p}+T_{t,1}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;laminar-free-stream-shear-flow-jets-wakes-mixing-layers&quot;&gt;Laminar Free Stream Shear Flow (Jets, Wakes, Mixing Layers)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A class of problems involving a large unbounded region and either excess momentum (i.e. a jet or plume) or a momentum deficit (i.e. wake). This section will be completed at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While viscous flow deals with liquids, or flows that are very slow, compressible flow is for your rockets and airplanes. In this Reynold’s number regime, the density of a fluid cannot assumed to be constant, but luckily we can ignore viscous effects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stagnation-properties&quot;&gt;Stagnation Properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any steady state fluid in motion, we can define stagnation/total properties. These reflect the actual values if the fluid were brought to rest isentropically.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{T_{Total}}{T}=\ \left(\frac{P_{Total}}{P}\right)^\sfrac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}=\left(\frac{\rho_{Total}}{\rho}\right)^{\gamma-1}=1+\left(\frac{\gamma-1}{2}\right)M^2\]

&lt;p&gt;Note that the stagnation properties are frame dependent and thus not intrinsic thermodynamic properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;waves&quot;&gt;Waves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of fluid dynamics, a wave is simply a disturbance which propagates. This disturbance can have many properties and effects on the fluid as it passes through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can increase/decrease a property of the fluid (density, pressure, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can change the velocity of the fluid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The magnitude of the change can be large or small&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The shape of the disturbance can be continuous or discontinuous&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can be isentropic/increase entropy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can propagate faster than the local acoustic speed or at the acoustic speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this definition, a shock is a type of wave. Although shocks are often introduced as “stationary” objects, this is because we have shifted our frame of reference such that this the case. A shock can be stationary (like at the inlet of a ramjet), or a shock can propagate (like out from an explosion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
Another way to think of waves is as the propagation of information. Here&apos;s an example you might be familiar with: take a water droplet hitting the surface of a pond. Waves carry information about the event (the falling water) outwards. The speed at which the wave moves out is the speed at which this information is carried. 

Every fluid has a local &quot;acoustic speed&quot; or **speed of sound**. This is the maximum speed at which waves can propagate. So here&apos;s a question for you, what happens when a disturbing even (like an airplane) moves faster than the local speed of sound? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acoustic-wave-theory&quot;&gt;Acoustic Wave Theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An acoustic wave is the propagation of wave with small magnitude through a medium. This wave travels at the local acoustic speed of the medium and is adiabatic (i.e. the energy of the medium before and after the wave has passed through remains constant). 
Given the initial conditions about the displacement and rate, the solution for the propagation of that disturbance can be found (d’Alembert’s Formula).&lt;/p&gt;

\[∆px,t=0=fx\]

\[∂∆p∂tx,t=0=gx\]

\[∆px,t=fx-a∞t+fx+a∞t2+12a∞x-a∞tx+a∞tgsds\]

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental result is that the initial disturbance splits into a left running and right running portion. The fluid velocity, pressure and density can also be related to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

\[∆u= ±a∞ρ∞∆ρ\]

\[∆ρ= ±1a∞2∆P\]

\[∆ρ= ±1ρ∞a∞∆P\]

&lt;p&gt;In deriving the above equation, we’ve assumed small amplitudes, meaning that the local speed of sound remains constant through the disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we remove this assumption, the local speed at which the disturbance propagates will be proportional to the magnitude and shape of the disturbance. This leads to finite strength waves and the method of characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;method-of-characteristics&quot;&gt;Method of Characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright here’s where it get complicated. It turns out that when we no longer assume a constant speed of sound, the equations are a tad unsolvable as they are. To this end, mathemeticians have defined a way around this. Instead of solving the entire system for every point in space, we can define some &lt;em&gt;characteristic lines&lt;/em&gt;. We can apply a constraint (i.e. some property is constant along the line), and this gives us the final equation we need to solve the system. Then if we define many lines, we can nearly cover the entire region we are solving for. By applying constraints at their intersection points, we can solve a big system of equations and have an approximate solution to our problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1d-unsteady-moc&quot;&gt;1D Unsteady MOC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, well I’ve outlined the principle behind it, but I need to actually write the section on how to do this. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2d-steady-moc&quot;&gt;2D Steady MOC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minimum-length-nozzle-calculation-using-moc&quot;&gt;Minimum Length Nozzle Calculation using MOC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With MOC, it is possible to design a nozzle such that the local curvature exactly cancels any incident expansion waves (these result from the diverging section right after the throat). 
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shocks&quot;&gt;Shocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shocks occur when objects travel faster than the acoustic speed of the fluid it’s in (speed measured relative to the fluid). This leads to a sudden discontinuity in the fluid’s properties as it transitions from supersonic to subsonic velocities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;normal-shocks&quot;&gt;Normal Shocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across a normal shock: total temperature remains constant, total pressure decreases, but static pressure and static temperature increase. Density increases, speed decreases. 
Derivation of Normal Shock Equations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continuity Equation: 				\(\rho_1u_1=\rho_2u_2\)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Momentum Conservation Equation:		\({P_1+\rho}_1{u_1}^2=P_2+\rho_2{u_2}^2\)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy Conservation Equation		\(h_1+\frac{1}{2}u_1^2=h_2+\frac{1}{2}u_2^2\)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideal Gas Law					\(PV=nRT\)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calorically Perfect Gas Assumption		\(h=\ C_pT\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above represents 5 equations with 5 unknowns (assuming we know the properties at state 1, upstream of the shock). They can be solved to show the following equations:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{P_2}{P_1}=1+\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1}\left(M_1^2-1\right)\]

\[\frac{T_2}{T_1}=\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1}\left(M_1^2-1\right)\right]\left[\frac{2+(\gamma-1)M_1^2}{(\gamma+1)M_1^2}\right]\]

\[\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}=\frac{u_1}{u_2}=\frac{(\gamma+1)M_1^2}{2+(\gamma-1)M_1^2}\]

\[{M_2}^2=\frac{1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2}{\gamma M_1^2-\frac{\gamma-1}{2}}\]

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;oblique-shocks&quot;&gt;Oblique Shocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supersonic flow over an angle. From the conservation equations, there are two equally valid solutions to an oblique shock problem, a strong solution and a weak solution. It is also possible that for a given combination of turning angle and incoming Mach number, there is no solution. Instead, the oblique shock becomes a detached or bow shock.&lt;/p&gt;

\[M_{n,1}=M_1\sin{\left(\sigma\right)}\]

\[M_2=\ \frac{M_{2n}}{\sin\funcapply(\sigma-\delta)}\]

\[\tan{\left(\delta\right)}=2\cot\funcapply(\sigma)\left[\frac{M_1^2{sin}^2\left(\sigma\right)-1}{M_1^2\left(\gamma+cos\left(2\sigma\right)\right)+2}\right]\]

&lt;p&gt;Unless there is some downstream flow feature to support the strong shock, the weak solution is typically what develops. 
The presence of a shock introduces a sudden change in the fluid properties, including pressure. This leads to the creation of wave drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some important takeaways from the above figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The red line denotes the maximum shock wave angle that is possible for a given incoming Mach number and deflection angle. If either one is increased while the other is kept constant, the shock will detach.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After a strong shock, the fluid is always subsonic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fter a weak shock, the fluid can be either subsonic OR supersonic. This is the region bounded by the red and blue dotted lines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The strong limit is the normal shock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;detached-shock&quot;&gt;Detached Shock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detached or bow shock is just an oblique shock problem in which a range of deflection angles (0 to 90 degrees) are present. At the centerline, fluid flow is perfectly perpendicular to the bow shock, and so it is treated as a normal shock. Traveling away from the center, the fluid flow has velocity partially parallel to the shock. This is equivalent to an oblique shock at some deflection angle. Infinitely far away, the deflection angle reaches 0 degrees and hence no shock develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that there are two regions behind the bow shock, a subsonic flow region, and a supersonic flow region. The dividing line between these two regimes is defined by the point along the bow shock where M2 = 1, or the blue dotted line in the figure above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expansion-fans&quot;&gt;Expansion Fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact opposite of an oblique shock, in which the boundary curves away from the flow direction. An expansion fan is formed as a continuous spread of Mach/Acoustic waves, each providing some infinitesimal change to the fluid properties. Thus, flow through an expansion fan is isentropic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prandtl-meyer-function&quot;&gt;Prandtl-Meyer Function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flow angle can be related to the local Mach number by applying continuity and conservation laws across an expansion wave. The resulting expression is the Prandtl-Meyer Function.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\theta_2-\theta_1=v\left(M_2\right)-v(M_1)\]

\[v\left(M\right)=\ \sqrt{\frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1}}arctan\sqrt{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1}(M^2-1)}-arctan\sqrt{M^2-1}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a solid boundary, waves reflect in a like manner. That is, a shock reflects as a shock, and an expansion wave reflects as an expansion wave. This maintains the kinematic constraint that flow near a wall must be parallel to it (i.e. no penetration).
At a free boundary, waves reflect in opposite manners. A shock reflects as an expansion wave, while an expansion wave reflects and converges as a shock. Across a free boundary, the pressure must be equal, and the flow in both regions must be parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactions-of-shockwaves&quot;&gt;Interactions of Shockwaves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expansion-wave-interactions-method-of-characteristics&quot;&gt;Expansion Wave Interactions (Method of Characteristics)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compressible-boundary-layers&quot;&gt;Compressible Boundary Layers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key feature of compressible boundary layers is that temperature and enthalpy changes cannot be decoupled from the velocity profile. Thus, even if the wall is adiabatic, the flow itself is neither adiabatic or isentropic (viscous dissipation). Consider the steady case where Prandtl number is equal to 1 (not a bad assumption with gases). This is also known as the Crocco-Busemann Relations.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\Pr{=\ \frac{\mu C_p}{k}}\]

&lt;p&gt;For an arbitrary pressure gradient, the temperature distribution takes the following form. This condition is satisfied for isentropic flow outside the boundary layer.&lt;/p&gt;

\[T=T_e\left[1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M_e^2\left(1-\frac{u^2}{U_e^2}\right)\right]\]

&lt;p&gt;For this scenario, the adiabatic wall temperature is equal to the stagnation temperature of the free stream. Recovery factor is 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second scenario is for zero pressure gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

\[T-T_w=\left(T_{oe}-T_w\right)\frac{u}{U_e}-\frac{u^2}{2C_p}\]

&lt;p&gt;The similar solution to the adiabatic wall temperature can be found for cases of Prandtl number larger than one with the following expression.&lt;/p&gt;

\[T_{aw}=T_e\left[1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}\sqrt{Pr}M_e^2\right]\]

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adiabatic-wall-temperature&quot;&gt;Adiabatic Wall Temperature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the wall temperature for a fluid flow such that there is no net heat transfer into or out of the wall. If a system is let to run until equilibrium, this is the steady state temperature the immersed object will reach.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//turbulent</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In general, turbulent flow is modeled statistically. Averages values are used instead of exact ones. Before laminar flow becomes fully turbulent, it experiences transition. Transition begins with flow instability. The point at which a flow trips into instability (critical point) is distinct from the point at which flow transitions fully to turbulence (transition point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;squires-law&quot;&gt;Squire’s Law&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two-dimensional parallel flow, the minimum critical unstable Reynold’s number occurs for a two-dimensional disturbance propagating in the same direction. Really all that this Law states is that a turbulence is tripped in the direction of disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;orr-sommerfeld-equation&quot;&gt;Orr-Sommerfeld Equation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equation describing the velocity distribution of a two-dimensional disturbance propagating in the same direction as a two-dimensional parallel flow can found to be exactly:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\left(U-c\right)\left(\phi^{\prime\prime}-\alpha^2\phi\right)-U^{\prime\prime}\phi+i\frac{\mathbit{\nu}}{\alpha}\left(\phi^{\prime\prime\prime\prime}-2\alpha^2\phi^{\prime\prime}+\alpha^4\phi\right)=\ 0\]

\[\Psi\left(x,y,t\right)=\ \phi\left(y\right)exp\left(i\left[\alpha x-\beta t\right]\right)\]

\[c=\sfrac{\beta}{\alpha}\]

&lt;p&gt;Where U is the velocity of the free stream, α is the wavenumber, c is the wave speed, and the frequency, ω = αc. The primes denote differentiation with respect to y. This is a fourth order linear differential equation. Disturbances must vanish at walls and an infinity. The temporal growth and spatial growth of disturbances are functions of the following form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Temporal: \(f\left(Re,\ \alpha,\ c_r,\ c_i\right)=0\)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spatial: \(g\left(Re,\ \alpha_r,\ \alpha_i,\ \omega\right)=0\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temporal neutral stability occurs when ci is equal to zero, while spatial neutral stability occurs for αi equal to zero. Instability begins at ci greater than zero. A full analytical solution of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation is non-trivial. In general, a non-dimensionalized version of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation can be written and can be plotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wavenumber&quot;&gt;Wavenumber&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wavenumber is the waves per unit space. It is distinct from frequency, which is the waves per unit time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rayleigh-inviscid-stability-theory&quot;&gt;Rayleigh Inviscid Stability Theory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the limiting case where the viscous term in the Orr-Sommerfeld equation is neglected. In particular, the following five theorems are outlined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is necessary for instability that the velocity profile have a point of inflection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is further necessary for instability that the numerical value of U’ of the vorticity be a maximum at the point of inflection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a point of inflection exists, it is further necessary that U’’(U-UPI) &amp;lt; 0 somewhere on the profile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If U(y) possesses an inflection point, a neutral disturbance may exist who phase velocity is given by cr.
  The phase velocity of an amplified disturbance must always lie between the minimum and maximum values of U(y).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;predicting-instability--transition-in-practice&quot;&gt;Predicting Instability &amp;amp; Transition in Practice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was found that for many different profiles and conditions, the critical transition Reynold’s number seems to depend only on the shape factor. Thus, if the shape factor can be found, one can predict the point of instability and transition. 
Several models have been proposed to find an equivalent transition point. Wazzan uses a similar approach to instability and finds a transition Reynold’s number as a function of the shape factor. There is no universal curve that accounts for free stream turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improving-stability&quot;&gt;Improving Stability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A favorable pressure gradient (decreasing pressure) delays the onset of instability, or in cases bring a flow back into stability. Boundary layers in gases are stabilized by cooling the wall, while boundary layers in liquids are stabilized by heating the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transition-to-turbulence&quot;&gt;Transition to Turbulence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps leading to fully developed turbulence are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-linear development waves (Tollmien-Schlichting Waves)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three-dimensional instability and streamwise vortices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Formation of turbulent spots&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully developed turbulence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reynolds-averaged-navier-stokes-equation-rans&quot;&gt;Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes Equation (RANS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are time averaged forms of the Navier-Stokes equations. Properties of the fluid are expressed in terms of an average and fluctuation term. An especially interesting result is the resultant equation for local stress.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau=\ \mu\left[\frac{\partial\bar{u}}{\partial\bar{y}}+\frac{\partial\bar{v}}{\partial\bar{x}}\right]-\rho\bar{u\prime v\prime}\]

&lt;p&gt;The first term is the laminar stress, while the second term is an equivalent turbulent “Reynolds Stress”. Importantly, note that it is independent of viscosity. This means that in regions dominated by the Reynold’s stress, viscosity of the fluid is unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wall-bounded-turbulent-flow&quot;&gt;Wall Bounded Turbulent Flow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the wall, fluctuations must be near zero, so laminar contributions are more important. Away from the wall, turbulent stress dominates. The velocity profile from a wall then has three components, a viscous dominates inner layer, a turbulent dominated outer layer, and an overlap layer. First, we define the friction velocity:&lt;/p&gt;

\[v^\ast=\sqrt{\frac{\tau_w}{\rho}}\]

&lt;p&gt;The average velocity and position are also re-written.&lt;/p&gt;

\[u^+=\frac{\bar{u}}{v^\ast}\]

\[y^+=\frac{\rho v^\ast y}{\mu}\]

&lt;p&gt;The following is equation can then model the inner layer, overlap layer, and outer layer.&lt;/p&gt;

\[u^+=\frac{1}{k}\ln{\left(y^+\right)}+B+\frac{2\Pi}{k}f(\eta)\]

\[f\left(\eta\right)=\sin^2{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\eta\right)}\]

&lt;p&gt;Where k and B are universal constants equal to 0.41 and 5.0 respectively. The first term captures the logarithmic relationship in the overlap section, while the second capture the diverging effect in the outer layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very, very near the wall, viscous and laminar forces dominate. The velocity profile in this region is linear and proportional to the wall stress. It is called the viscous sublayer.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau_w=\mu\frac{\bar{u}}{\bar{y}}\]

\[u^+=y^+\]

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turbulent-pipe-flow&quot;&gt;Turbulent Pipe Flow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the above model, you can actually derive an expression for the Darcy-friction factor from the flow equation. Note that this is for a smooth pipe, and so when possible, you should still reference a moody chart. In any case, the following is useful for seeing that the Darcy-Friction is not just an empirically derived fit.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{1}{\Lambda^{1/2}}=2.0\log_{10}{\left({Re}_D\Lambda^\frac{1}{2}\right)}-0.8\]

\[Notably the following trends come out:\]

\[\tau\approx0.0396\rho^{3/4}\mu^{7/4}D^{-1/4}{U_{avg}}^{7/4}\]

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turbulent-boundary-layers&quot;&gt;Turbulent Boundary Layers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the wall bounded turbulent model, the skin coefficient term can be approximated in terms of the boundary layer thickness Reynolds number. Meanwhile, the momentum thickness is evaluated by using a one-seventh power law profile taken from pipe flow data.&lt;/p&gt;

\[C_f=2\frac{d\theta}{dx}\]

\[\frac{\bar{u}}{U_e}\approx\left(\frac{y}{\delta}\right)^{1/7}\]

\[C_f\approx0.020{Re}_\delta^{-1/6}\]

\[{Re}_\delta\approx0.16{Re}_x^{6/7}\]

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a series of random topics, including non-dimensional numbers and fluid statics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-dimensional-numbers&quot;&gt;Non-Dimensional Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a whole bunch. Here are the main ones that you might come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reynolds-number&quot;&gt;Reynold’s Number&lt;/h4&gt;

\[\frac{\rho UL}{\mu}\]

&lt;p&gt;Ratio of viscous forces to inertia forces. Determines flow regime (Laminar, turbulent, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mach-number&quot;&gt;Mach Number&lt;/h4&gt;

\[\frac{u}{a}\]

&lt;p&gt;Ratio of flow velocity to speed of sound. The higher the Mach number, the more irreversible the flow becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;knudsen-number&quot;&gt;Knudsen Number&lt;/h4&gt;

\[\frac{\lambda}{L}\]

&lt;p&gt;Ratio of molecular mean free path to characteristic length. Determines transition from gas dynamics to continuum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prandtl-number&quot;&gt;Prandtl Number&lt;/h4&gt;

\[\frac{C_p\mu}{k}\]

&lt;p&gt;Ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. In other words, ratio of the dominance of convection to conduction. Also relates momentum vs thermal boundary layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stokes-number&quot;&gt;Stokes Number&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nusselt-number&quot;&gt;Nusselt Number&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fluid-statics&quot;&gt;Fluid Statics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forces always act perpendicular to the surface. Given atmospheric surface pressure (free surface) the pressure at a depth (h) will be:&lt;/p&gt;

\[P=\ \gamma h\]

&lt;p&gt;Where \(\gamma\) is the specific gravity of the liquid, (1 for water). For submerged plate of area, A, total resultant force is equal to:&lt;/p&gt;

\[F_r=\gamma h_cA\]

&lt;p&gt;Where hc is the depth of the centroid of the plate. This total force DOES NOT act through the centroid however, instead it acts at through a point where the total moment is equal to zero (center of pressure or can think of this as the centroid of the pressure distribution). If the plate is symmetric, this will coincide with the centroid. 
For curved surfaces, use the following force balance approach:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jet Engines</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//jetEngines/"/>
   <updated>2021-05-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//jets</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 1941, a Messerschmitt Me 262 became the world’s first operational jet powered aircraft. Relying on combustion and a nozzle, the new “jet engine” was conceptually more similar to a rocket than a propeller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;80 years later, jet engines have continued to rule the aviation world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;TSFC&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Thrust specific fuel consumption&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;SFC&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Specific fuel consumption&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of simplicity, jet engines can be analyzed as a quasi 1 dimensional system, that is, we only need to consider velocities in one direction. This makes our math much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fundamentals&quot;&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/h3&gt;

\[F_{uninstalled}=\dot{m_9}u_9-\dot{m_0}u_0-A_{exit}(P_9-P_0)\]

\[&quot;{Takeoff\ Thrust&quot;\ F}_{gross}=\dot{m_9}u_9-A_{exit}(P_9-P_0)\]

\[\mathrm{TSFC}=\ \frac{\dot{m_f}}{T}=\frac{1}{g Isp_f}=\frac{f}{g Isp_{air}}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;combustion&quot;&gt;Combustion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combustion is still the driving force behind all jet engines. The energy added to the air gets converted into kinetic energy by a nozzle, thereby producing thrust.&lt;/p&gt;

\[C_xH_y+\left(x+\frac{y}{4}\right)\left(O_2+{3.76N}_2\right)\leftrightarrow xCO_2+\left(\frac{y}{2}\right)H_2O+(x+\frac{y}{4})N_2\]

\[\phi=\ \frac{f}{f_{stoich}}\]

\[f_{stoich}=\ \frac{M_{Fuel}}{(x+\frac{y}{4})(M_{O2}+3.76M_{N2})}\]

&lt;p&gt;Combustion does not always happen to completion and fuels are not made of a singular type of hydrocarbon. This means that as equivalence ratio tends to 1, actual flame temperature is lower than the ideal value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Equivalence Ratio&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Type of Combustion Environment&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(\phi&amp;lt;1\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fuel Lean&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(\phi=1\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Stoichiometric&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(\phi&amp;gt;1\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fuel Rich&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adiabatic-flame-temperature&quot;&gt;Adiabatic Flame Temperature&lt;/h3&gt;

\[Q_R=Energy\ gained\ in\ combustion=\sum{(nh_{f,\ products})}-\sum{(nh_{f,\ reactants})}\]

\[Q_R+{\sum{nc_p(T_2-T_f)}}_{Products}=\ {\sum{nc_p(T_1-T_f)}}_{Reactants}\]

&lt;p&gt;In other words, energy is released by combustion reaction, and this energy goes into heating up the products. Note that for the above equation we assume that cp does not vary with temperature (even though it does!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ideal-turbojet-cycle&quot;&gt;Ideal Turbojet Cycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each stage in a turbojet, we can abstract the relative change in temperature and pressure of air passing through. In this way, if we know the initial conditions of incoming air, we can easily find the temperature and pressure at any stage. Of note, we are comparing stagnation temperatures and stangation pressures (since this a measure of the “total” energy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/jetBasic.png&quot; alt=&quot;turbojet&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Diffuser&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Compressor&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Burner&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Turbine&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Nozzle&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;π (Pressure Ratio)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\({\tau_c}^{\gamma/(\gamma-1)}\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\({\tau_t}^{\gamma/(\gamma-1)}\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;τ (Temp Ratio)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(\tau_c\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(\tau_b\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;\(\tau_t\)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where τ &amp;amp; π are defined as the ratio of stagnation temperatures and pressures across the stage. The relationship between pressure ratio and temperature ratio is established by assuming assumed isentropic processes. We also define a unique value called the recovery temperature/pressure ratio, which is the ratio of stagnation temperature/pressure to local temperature/pressure at station 0.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{T_{t0}}{T_0}=1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2=\ \tau_r\]

\[\tau_\lambda=\tau_r\tau_c\tau_b=\frac{T_{t4}}{T_0}\]

&lt;p&gt;Note that for an ideal turbojet without an afterburner, the ratio of outlet state temperature to inlet temperature is the same as burner temperature ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau_b=\frac{T_9}{T_0}\]

\[Isp_{air}=\ \frac{a_0M_0}{g}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\tau_b(\tau_r\tau_c\tau_t-1)}{\tau_r-1}}-1\right)=\frac{T}{\dot{m_0}g}\]

&lt;p&gt;Assuming all fuel is burned in combustor, where f is the fuel to air ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

\[f=\ \frac{c_pT_0}{Q_R}\tau_r\tau_c(\tau_b-1)\]

&lt;p&gt;Also, if turbine work is equal to compressor work:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau_r=\ \left[1-\frac{\tau_c-1}{\tau_c\tau_b}\right]\]

&lt;p&gt;\(Isp_{air}\) for an ideal turbojet can then be solved if we are given the recovery temperature ratio, compressor ratio and the maximum temperature at station 4 after the burner.&lt;/p&gt;

\[Isp_{air}=\ \frac{a_0M_0}{g}\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tau_r-1}\left[\tau_\lambda\left(1-\frac{1}{\tau_r\tau_c}\right)-\tau_r(\tau_c-1)\right]}-1\right)\]

&lt;p&gt;We can also find the ratio of outlet to inlet velocity&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{u_9}{u_0}=\ \left(\frac{M_9}{M_0}\right)\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_9R_9T_9}{\gamma_0R_0T_0}}=\ \sqrt{\frac{\tau_b(\tau_r\tau_c\tau_t-1)}{\tau_r-1}}\]

&lt;p&gt;Which can be found by first realizing that the following holds true&lt;/p&gt;

\[\left(\frac{P_{t9}}{P_9}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}=\frac{T_{t9}}{T_9}=\ \frac{T_0}{T_9}\tau_r\tau_d\tau_c\tau_b\tau_t\tau_n\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engine-efficiencies&quot;&gt;Engine Efficiencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Propulsive Efficiency&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
\[\eta_p=\frac{P_{prop}}{P_{KE}}\cong\frac{2\frac{u_o}{u_e}}{1+\frac{u_o}{u_e}}\]
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Thermal Efficiency&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
\[\eta_{th}=\frac{P_{KE}}{P_{in}}=\frac{\left\{\left(\dot{m_0}+\dot{m_f}\right)\frac{ u_e^2}{2}-\dot{m_0}\frac{ u_0^2}{2}\right\}}{\dot{m_f}Q_R}=1-\frac{T_9-T_0}{T_{t4}-T_{t3}}=1-\frac{1}{\tau_r\tau_c}\]
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Total Efficiency&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
\[\eta_0=\eta_{th}\eta_p=\frac{P_{Prop}}{P_{in}}=\ \frac{Thrust\ast u_0}{\dot{m_f}Q_R}\]
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;real-component-analysis&quot;&gt;Real Component Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

\[\eta_d=\ \frac{\left(\frac{P_{t2}}{P_0}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}-1}{\frac{\gamma-1}{2}{M_0}^2}\]

\[\eta_c=\ \frac{\left(\pi_c\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}-1}{\tau_c-1}\]

\[\eta_b=\frac{c_pT_0}{Q_Rf}\tau_r\tau_c(\tau_b-1)\]

\[\eta_t=\ \frac{\left(\pi_c\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}-1}{\tau_c-1}\]

\[\eta_t=\ \frac{\left(NPR\frac{P_0}{P_9}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}-\left(\pi_n\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}{\left(NPR\frac{P_0}{P_9}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}-1}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ NPR=\ \frac{P_{t5}}{P_0}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ramjets&quot;&gt;Ramjets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramjets function like a turbojet, but do not include a turbine or compressor. Most of the original equations still apply. Set \(\tau_c=\ \tau_t=1\).&lt;/p&gt;

\[Isp_{air}=\ \frac{a_0M_0}{g}\left(\sqrt{\tau_b}-1\right)\]

\[TSFC=\frac{f}{a_0M_0}\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{\tau_b}-1}\right]\]

&lt;p&gt;Note that ramjet combustors tend to operate at a higher equivalence ratio. This means that some fuel remains un-combusted, and thus we need to revisit certain assumptions we made about turbojets. In particular, we must use \(∆T_{equilibrium}\). This value will depend on initial temperature, and equivalence ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering a real ramjet, diffuser and nozzle are still largely adiabatic, but there is an associated drop in total pressure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;afterburners&quot;&gt;Afterburners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An afterburner is like attaching a ramjet to the back of a turbojet. Turbojet exhaust is combusted again, increasing thrust at the cost of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/afterBurner.png&quot; alt=&quot;afterburner&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau_b\tau_{ab}=\frac{T_9}{T_0}\]

\[Isp_{air}=\ \frac{a_0M_0}{g}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\tau_{ab}}{\tau_r-1}\left[\tau_\lambda\left(1-\frac{1}{\tau_r\tau_c}\right)-\tau_r(\tau_c-1)\right]}-1\right)\]

\[TSFC=\ \frac{1}{g{Isp}_{air}}\frac{c_pT_0}{\dot{Q_R}}\left[\tau_r\tau_c\left(\tau_b-1\right)+\tau_r\tau_c\tau_b\tau_t(\tau_{ab}-1)\right]\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turbofans&quot;&gt;Turbofans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A turbofan makes of use the turbine in a turbojet to generate shaft power which drives a ducted fan. It provides increased efficiency over a regular turbojet. Most commercial passenger planes fly with turbofan engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/turboFan.png&quot; alt=&quot;turboFan&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha=\ \frac{air\ flow\ rate\ through\ bypass\ cycle}{air\ flow\ rate\ through\ turbojet\ cycle}\]

\[Thrust=\ \dot{m_0}u_9+\alpha\dot{m_0}u_{19}-(1+\alpha)\dot{m_0}u_0\]

&lt;p&gt;Alpha is defined as the bypass ratio. Flow through the center should be treated like flow through the turbojet. Flow through the fan can be treated like flow through a compressor. Note that for the following equations we assume to interference in exhaust from the bypass and the turbojet.
Assume: Work absorbed by turbine = work done by compressor + work done by fan.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\dot{m_0}\left(h_{t3}-h_{t2}\right)+\ \alpha\dot{m_0}\left(h_{t13}-h_{t2}\right)=\ \eta_{mechanical}\dot{m_0}(1+f)\left(h_{t4}-h_{t5}\right)\]

\[\tau_t=1-\frac{\tau_r\left[\left(\tau_r-1\right)+\alpha(\tau_f-1)\right]}{\eta_{mechanical}(1+f)\tau_\lambda}\]

&lt;p&gt;If ideal, since no combustion occurs, T19 = T0.&lt;/p&gt;

\[Isp_{air}=\ \frac{a_0M_0}{g}\left[\frac{1+f}{1+\alpha}\left(\frac{u_9}{u_0}\right)+\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}\left(\frac{u_{19}}{u_0}\right)-1\right]\]

\[\frac{u_{19}}{u_0}=\ \left(\frac{M_{19}}{M_0}\right)\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_{19}R_{19}T_{19}}{\gamma_0R_0T_0}}\]

&lt;p&gt;As with a regular turbojet cycle, we can solve for the M19 and the ratio of temperatures by using the following setup. Notice that for an ideal scenario, the ratio of temperatures before and after the fan is 1, since no combustion occurs, thus you only need to find M19 using the relationships below.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\left(\frac{P_{t19}}{P_{19}}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}=\frac{T_{t19}}{T_{19}}=1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}{M_{19}}^2\]

\[(\frac{P_0}{P_{19}}\pi_r\pi_d\pi_{fan}\pi_n)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}=\frac{T_0}{T_{19}}(\tau_r \tau_{fan})\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turboprops&quot;&gt;Turboprops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turboprops operate on a similar idea to turbofans, in that the turbine from the turbojet cycle drives a larger propeller out in front, which is ultimately responsible for generating most of the thrust. Yields increased efficiency. Notice that for this analysis we break the turbine into two parts, the first (4 to 4.5) drives the compressor, while the second (4.5 to 5) drives the propeller.&lt;/p&gt;

\[T_{prop}u_0=\ \dot{m_0}(1+f)\alpha\eta_{mechanical,\ LPT}\eta_{LPT}\eta_{gearbox}\eta_{propeller}(h_{t4.5}-h_{9s})\]

&lt;p&gt;Where LPT stands for low pressure turbine (which drives propeller)&lt;/p&gt;

\[Power\ Split:\ \alpha=\ \frac{h_{t4.5}-h_{t5s}}{h_{t4.5}-h_{9s}}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inletsdiffusers&quot;&gt;Inlets/Diffusers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shock Ramp Inlets take advantage of oblique shocks to achieve near isentropic compression and minimize drag.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{\dot{m}}{A}=MP_t\sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{RT_t}}\left[1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right]^\frac{-\gamma-1}{2(\gamma-1)}\]

\[c_{pr}=\frac{P_2-P_1}{q_1}\]

&lt;p&gt;Starting Problem refers to the issue of how we can transition from subsonic to supersonic flow on a converging-diverging inlet. In general, it involves the questions of how to “swallow the shock”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overspeed – By increasing M0 the bow shock moves closer towards the inlet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kantrowitz Donaldson Inlet – fixed geometry CD inlet with an enlarged throat that places starting shock in the diverging section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variable Geometry Inlet – For maximum efficiency, starting shock should occur in the throat. Thus, throat begins initially enlarged to swallow the shock, and then closes to push the shock upstream closer to the throat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;combustors&quot;&gt;Combustors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law of mass action presents a way to calculate reaction rate. Equilibrium occurs when rate of products becoming reactants equals the rate of reactants becoming products.&lt;/p&gt;

\[r_{foward}=k_{forward}\left[A\right]^a\left[B\right]^b\]

\[K=\ \frac{k_{forward}}{k_{reverse}}=\frac{\left[C\right]^c\left[D\right]^d}{\left[A\right]^a\left[B\right]^b}\]

&lt;p&gt;Note that equilibrium constant can also be represented with partial pressure, or mole fraction.
Laminar Flame Speeds tend to be on the order of 0.1-3 m/s, which is much slower than flight speeds. To prevent blowout, flame holders are sometimes required to slow down the flow. These also exert a drag on the flow, resulting in the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{P_{t4}}{P_{t3}}=\frac{\left(1+\gamma{M_4}^2\left(1-\frac{C_d}{2}\right)\right)}{\left(1+\gamma{M_4}^2\right)}\left[\frac{1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}{M_4}^2}{1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}{M_3}^2}\right]^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;axial-compressors&quot;&gt;Axial Compressors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compressors consist of multiple stages. Each stage involves 1 rotor, followed by 1 stator. Rotor drives the fluid, giving it angular velocity, and increases total pressure. Stator converts extra angular velocity into an increase in static pressure but does no work on the fluid itself. Multi-staging is necessary to avoid boundary layer separation in rotor (which faces an adverse pressure gradient). We’ll define the absolute fluid velocity as \(C\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/rotAndStat.png&quot; alt=&quot;rotor and stator&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Fluid Velocity Relative to Rotor&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
\[W=C-U\]
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

\[\tau=\ \dot{m}[r_2C_{\theta,2}-r_1C_{\theta,1}]\]

\[h_{t2}-h_{t1}=\ \omega[r_2C_{\theta,2}-r_1C_{\theta,1}]\]

&lt;p&gt;Assume that C1 = C3 and Cz remains constant from stage 1 through stage 3. For small changes in stage pressure, and where stage efficiency is all the same, stage efficiency nstage is approximately equal to polytrophic compressor efficiency etc.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\beta_1=\alpha_2\]

\[\beta_2=\alpha_1\]

\[\frac{P_{t3}}{P_{t1}}=\left[1+\eta_{stage}\frac{U\Delta C_\theta}{c_pT_{t1}}\right]^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}\]

\[\frac{T_{t2}}{T_{t1}}=1+\frac{U^2}{c_pT_{t1}}\left[1+\frac{C_z}{U}\left(\tan{\left(\beta_2\right)}-\tan(\alpha_1)\right)\right]\]

&lt;p&gt;It is also useful to define unitless parameters to characterize axial compressor performance. Increasing the flow coefficient decreases total temperature rise and work contribution of the rotor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Flow Coefficient&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
\[\phi=\ \frac{C_z}{U}\]
  &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Stage Loading Factor&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
\[\psi= \frac{\Delta h_t}{U^2} = 1+\phi(\tan(\beta_2)-\tan(\alpha_1)\]
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;degree-of-reaction-for-compressor&quot;&gt;Degree of Reaction for Compressor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define as the ratio of static enthalpy rise over the rotor to total static enthalpy change in the stage. Usually we try to design this number to be equal to 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

\[R=\ \frac{h_2-h_1}{h_3-h_1}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;axial-turbines&quot;&gt;Axial Turbines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculations for an axial turbine is very similar to an axial compressor. In a turbine, a stator (or a nozzle) gives angular velocity to fluid flow, which drives the rotors. Since there is no adverse pressure gradient, fewer stages are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

\[R^o\ =1-\frac{C_{\theta2}-C_{\theta3}}{2U}\]

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Impulse Stage&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Entire static enthalpy drop happens over the stator/nozzle. Used when trying to minimize the number of stages (maximizing specific work per stage).&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;50% Degree of Reaction Stage&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;static enthalpy drop is split evenly between stator and rotor. Use to minimize losses and maximize isentropic efficiency.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;component-matching&quot;&gt;Component Matching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above equations, we can enforce the following constraints which allow us to solve the combined equations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turbine Angular Shaft Speed = Compressor Angular Shaft Speed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Constant mass flow rate of air&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work extracted by turbine = work done by compressor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Introducing Hyde</title>
   <link href="https://ludavid15.github.io//2013/12/28/introducing-hyde/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//2013/12/28/introducing-hyde</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hyde is a brazen two-column &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It’s based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://getpoole.com&quot;&gt;Poole&lt;/a&gt;, the Jekyll butler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-on-poole&quot;&gt;Built on Poole&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mdo&quot;&gt;@mdo&lt;/a&gt;. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, &lt;a href=&quot;/404&quot;&gt;404&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/atom.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, posts, and &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;example page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile friendly design and development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easily scalable text and component sizing with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; units in the CSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hyde-features&quot;&gt;Hyde features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout&quot;&gt;reverse&lt;/a&gt; (right sidebar), available via &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes&quot;&gt;Eight optional color schemes&lt;/a&gt;, available via &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme&quot;&gt;Head to the readme&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;browser-support&quot;&gt;Browser support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;download&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/hyde&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

  Howdy! This is an example blog post that shows several types of HTML content supported in this theme.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;dis parturient montes&lt;/a&gt;, nascetur ridiculus mus. &lt;em&gt;Aenean eu leo quam.&lt;/em&gt; Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etiam porta &lt;strong&gt;sem malesuada magna&lt;/strong&gt; mollis euismod. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inline-html-elements&quot;&gt;Inline HTML elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element&quot;&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;To italicize text&lt;/em&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abbreviations, like &lt;abbr title=&quot;HyperText Markup Langage&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with an optional &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the full phrase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citations, like &lt;cite&gt;— Mark otto&lt;/cite&gt;, should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Deleted&lt;/del&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;inserted&lt;/ins&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ins&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superscript &lt;sup&gt;text&lt;/sup&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and subscript &lt;sub&gt;text&lt;/sub&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

   <updated>2012-02-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>https://ludavid15.github.io//whats-jekyll</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown&quot;&gt;the project’s readme&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory […] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.&lt;/p&gt;
