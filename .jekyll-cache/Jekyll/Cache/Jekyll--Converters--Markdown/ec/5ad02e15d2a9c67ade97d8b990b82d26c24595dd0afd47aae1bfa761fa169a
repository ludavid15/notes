I"Â<p>A collection of common chord progressions I‚Äôve encountered. Though they come in all sorts of flavors and styles, many progressions are built on the idea of <strong>tension</strong> and <strong>release</strong>. We play dissonant chords to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the melody towards a nice resolution, which usually is the tonic chord (also known as the home chord).</p>

<h3 id="the-2-5-1">The 2-5-1</h3>

<p>Starts with the minor 7th on the second, the major 7th on the 5th, and finishes on the root.</p>

<h4 id="minor-2-5-1">Minor 2-5-1</h4>

<p>It‚Äôs the same chord progression, but this is the minor version. The <strong>ii</strong> which is normally a minor 7th, becomes a diminished</p>

<h4 id="extended-3-6-2-5-1">Extended 3-6-2-5-1</h4>

<p>Notice that we are adding chords according to their order along the circle of fifths. For instance, in the key of C, the 3rd (E) has 4 sharps, the 6th (A) has 3 sharps, the 2nd (D) has 2 sharps, and the 5th (G) has one sharp.</p>

<h3 id="tritone-substitutions">Tritone Substitutions</h3>

<p>This method is used on 2-5-1 progressions. We take the dominant fifth, and substitute a chord that is based on the note a tritone above. In the key of C, this means that the <strong>G7</strong> might be replaced by a <strong>C#7</strong>. This results in a chromatic sequence (<strong>D</strong> - <strong>C#</strong> - <strong>C</strong>).</p>

<h3 id="diminished-sixths">Diminished Sixths</h3>

<p>Sometimes also known as the Barry Harris progression.</p>
