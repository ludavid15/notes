I"T<p>This post takes a deeper look at variational auto encoders (VAE). Like regular auto encoders, a VAE maps a large dimension onto a small set of latent variables, from which we can reconstruct something very close to the original input. However, unlike regular auto encoders, a VAE uses a probability distribution in the latent space.</p>
