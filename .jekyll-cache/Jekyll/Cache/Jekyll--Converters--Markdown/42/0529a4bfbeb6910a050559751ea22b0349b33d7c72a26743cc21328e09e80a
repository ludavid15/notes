I"j<p>A collection of common chord progressions I’ve encountered. Though they come in all sorts of flavors and styles, many progressions are built on the idea of <strong>tension</strong> and <strong>release</strong>. We play dissonant chords to “push” the melody towards a nice resolution, which usually is the tonic chord (also known as the home chord).</p>
