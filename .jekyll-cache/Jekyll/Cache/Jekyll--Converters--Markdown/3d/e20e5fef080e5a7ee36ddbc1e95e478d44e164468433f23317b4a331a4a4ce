I"è<p>A random assortment of communications technology terms Iâ€™ve encountered over the years. Please keep in mind that electrical engineering and signal processing is <em>not</em> one of my subjects, so take everything here with a grain of salt.</p>

<h4 id="ml-std-1553">ML-STD 1553</h4>

<p>A traffic control protocol for managing information traffic from multiple sources on a shared physical line. 1553 requires a controlling bus computer (BC) and an addresses for each terminal. The underlying constraint of 1553 is that traffic is never parrallel. In other words, each terminal takes turns using the line, and ignores any information on the line while not actively in use. On any given 1553 line, there can be up to 31 <em>remote terminals</em> (RTs), each with their own <em>subaddresses</em>. A number of messages types are defined:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Controller to RT</li>
  <li>RT to Controller</li>
  <li>RT to RT</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="bi-level">Bi-Level</h4>

<p>Consisting of two states (i.e. 0 and 1). In constrast to <em>analog</em>.</p>

<h3 id="serial-communication">Serial communication</h3>

<p>Commmunication that consists of sending data one bit at a time.</p>

<h4 id="rs-422">RS-422</h4>

<p>A point to point interface which transmits digital/bi-level information by changing the difference in voltage between two lines. This allows for higher data rates and lower noise in comparison to a single voltage line because we can achieve the same total change in the difference with only half the voltage change in each line. This is comparable to things like ethernet or USB.</p>

<h4 id="parity">Parity</h4>

<p>A single bit which tells you if there is an even or odd number of 1â€™s in the transmitted signal. Used to check the integrity of a message.</p>

<h2 id="traveling-wave-tube-amplifier">Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier</h2>

<p>Often abbreviated to just TWTA, this is a device used for amplifying radio signals. Satellites often need this since they communicate over large distances.</p>
