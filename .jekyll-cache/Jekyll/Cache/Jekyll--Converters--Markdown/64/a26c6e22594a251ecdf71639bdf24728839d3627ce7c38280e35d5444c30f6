I".<p>Classical fluid dynamics is a subset continuum mechanics. This means theories of continuums apply to fluids (i.e. concepts of velocity, acceleration, &amp; strain).</p>

<p>In general, we want to find the following properties as a function of location and time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pressure</li>
  <li>Temperature</li>
  <li>Density</li>
  <li>Velocity</li>
  <li>Acceleration</li>
</ol>

<p>With the above information, we can find things like lift, drag, work, &amp; heat transfer (all very important for engineering applications). In a complete model, all 5 of these properties are closely related. Not surprisingly, it’s also difficult to solve for all 5 properties at once. Thus, the subject of fluid mechanics is further broken up into categories based on assumptions and simplifications. These assumptions allow us to make certain variables independent of other variables. The three most important “categories” are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Incompressible vs Compressible</li>
  <li>Inviscid vs Viscid</li>
  <li>Laminar vs Turbulent</li>
</ol>

<p>Any combinations of the above labels are technically possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compressible, Inviscid, Laminar = Shocks, expansion waves, acoustic waves</li>
  <li>Compressible, Viscid, Turbulent = Turbulent boundary layers, supersonic wakes</li>
  <li>Compressible, Viscid, Laminar = Hypersonic boundary layers</li>
  <li>Incompressible, Inviscid, Laminar = Potential flow theory</li>
  <li>Incompressible, Viscid, Laminar = Creeping flow, boundary layer theory</li>
</ol>

<p>We can solve any of the above scenarios by applying laws and equations such as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Thermodynamics</li>
  <li>Conservation Equations</li>
  <li>Gas Laws</li>
  <li>Continuum Mechanics</li>
  <li>Imposing additional constraints (i.e. isentropic, isobaric, isochoric, isothermal, steady)</li>
</ol>
