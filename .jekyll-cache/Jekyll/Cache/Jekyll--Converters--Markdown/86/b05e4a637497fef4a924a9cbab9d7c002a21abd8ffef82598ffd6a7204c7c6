I"Ì<p>There are two ways in which artifical intelligence has been applied to music. The first is called music information retrieval, or MIR for short. These programs produce data from audio (e.g. song identification, transcribing audio into sheet music). The second is known as <em>generative</em> AI. These programs try to produce new and original music, either fully autonomously or as a predictive aid to composers (i.e. like text predits on your phone!).</p>
