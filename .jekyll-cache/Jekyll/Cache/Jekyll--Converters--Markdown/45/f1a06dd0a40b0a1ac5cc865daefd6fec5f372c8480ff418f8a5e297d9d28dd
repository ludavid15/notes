        Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics

    <p>To be clear, when we talk about fluid mechanics, we aren‚Äôt just talking about the second state of matter (liquid \(\subset\) fluid). It honestly would make a lot more sense if we called it ‚Äúflow mechanics‚Äù, but too many textbooks have been printed now to change that. In any case, we‚Äôre stuck with the term fluid mechanics, so that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll be working with here.</p>

    <p>One of the common assumptions we make when working with fluids is that it forms a continuum. The individual atoms of a fluid are assumed to be tightly packed enough that we can approximate the collective molecular interactions. What are these collective molecular interactions? Well, pretty standard stuff actually. We assume that applying a force causes an object to move, or a body to deform. (Technically speaking, that stress is related to strain). And honestly well, that‚Äôs kinda it.</p>

<p>The reason this assumption is so powerful is because it makes our model <strong>continuous</strong>. This may seem pretty obvious at a glance, but working with stuff that is continuous is very different from working with stuff that is discrete! The reason as you may already have guessed: derivatives.</p>

    <p>Unlike solids, fluids deform constantly under stress (in other words, a fluid <strong>flows</strong>). How it flows is very much dependent on it‚Äôs <strong>viscosity</strong>.</p>

<p class="message">
Viscosity is to fluids what the modulus of elasticity is to solids. It relates the stress (amount of force) to strain (amount of deformation). Qualitatively, viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistence to flowing. Things like honey have a very high viscosity, while air and water have comparatively lower viscosity. 
</p>

<p>Viscous flow then, is the study of how a fluid‚Äôs viscosity affects its behavior. Viscous flow covers topics like boundary layers, low-speed flows, and small-scale flows. Coincidentally, the regimes in which viscous forces dominate is often incompressible, but this is not a hard and fast rule.</p>

    <p>In general, turbulent flow is modeled statistically. Averages values are used instead of exact ones. Before laminar flow becomes fully turbulent, it experiences transition. Transition begins with flow instability. The point at which a flow trips into instability (critical point) is distinct from the point at which flow transitions fully to turbulence (transition point).</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a whole bunch. Here are the main ones that you might come across.</p>

<h4 id="reynolds-number">Reynold‚Äôs Number</h4>

\[\frac{\rho UL}{\mu}\]

<p>Ratio of viscous forces to inertia forces. Determines flow regime (Laminar, turbulent, etc.).</p>

<h4 id="mach-number">Mach Number</h4>

\[\frac{u}{a}\]

<p>Ratio of flow velocity to speed of sound. The higher the Mach number, the more irreversible the flow becomes.</p>

<h4 id="knudsen-number">Knudsen Number</h4>

\[\frac{\lambda}{L}\]

<p>Ratio of molecular mean free path to characteristic length. Determines transition from gas dynamics to continuum mechanics.</p>

<h4 id="prandtl-number">Prandtl Number</h4>

\[\frac{C_p\mu}{k}\]

<p>Ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. In other words, ratio of the dominance of convection to conduction. Also relates momentum vs thermal boundary layers.</p>

<h4 id="stokes-number">Stokes Number</h4>

<h4 id="nusselt-number">Nusselt Number</h4>

<h2 id="fluid-statics">Fluid Statics</h2>

<p>Forces always act perpendicular to the surface. Given atmospheric surface pressure (free surface) the pressure at a depth (h) will be:</p>

\[P=\ \gamma h\]

<p>Where \(\gamma\) is the specific gravity of the liquid, (1 for water). For submerged plate of area, A, total resultant force is equal to:</p>

\[F_r=\gamma h_cA\]

<p>Where hc is the depth of the centroid of the plate. This total force DOES NOT act through the centroid however, instead it acts at through a point where the total moment is equal to zero (center of pressure or can think of this as the centroid of the pressure distribution). If the plate is symmetric, this will coincide with the centroid. 
For curved surfaces, use the following force balance approach:</p>
