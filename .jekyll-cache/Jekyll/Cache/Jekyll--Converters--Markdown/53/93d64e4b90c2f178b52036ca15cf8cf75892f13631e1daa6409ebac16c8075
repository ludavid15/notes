I"•	<p>A collection of common chord progressions I‚Äôve encountered. Though they come in all sorts of flavors and styles, many progressions are built on the idea of <strong>tension</strong> and <strong>release</strong>. We play dissonant chords to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the melody towards a nice resolution, which usually is the tonic chord (also known as the home chord).</p>

<h3 id="the-two-five-one">The Two-Five-One</h3>

<p>This is the bread and butter of jazz harmony. It starts with the minor 7th on the second, the major 7th on the 5th, and finishes on the root. Here are some variations:</p>

<h4 id="minor-2-5-1">Minor 2-5-1</h4>

<p>It‚Äôs the same chord progression, but this is the minor version. The <strong>ii</strong> which is normally a minor 7th, becomes a diminished</p>

<h4 id="extended-3-6-2-5-1">Extended 3-6-2-5-1</h4>

<p>Notice that we are adding chords according to their order along the circle of fifths. For instance, in the key of C, the 3rd (E) has 4 sharps, the 6th (A) has 3 sharps, the 2nd (D) has 2 sharps, and the 5th (G) has one sharp.</p>

<h4 id="tritone-substitutions">Tritone Substitutions</h4>

<p>We take the dominant fifth, and substitute a chord that is based on the note a tritone above. In the key of C, this means that the <strong>G7</strong> might be replaced by a <strong>C#7</strong>. This results in a chromatic sequence (<strong>D</strong> - <strong>C#</strong> - <strong>C</strong>).</p>

<h3 id="diminished-sixths">Diminished Sixths</h3>

<p>To explain this concept, let‚Äôs start simple. For a given tonic, there‚Äôs this concept of the dominant, which provides <em>tension</em>. Also in jazz, chords are often played with extensions, which means that the dominant often gets a flat 9, which is a flat 6th in the tonic key.</p>

<p>So this creates a new scale, where some notes, (the 2, 4, flat 6, 7) belong to the ‚Äúdominant‚Äù sound, and other notes, (the 1, 3, 5) belong to the ‚Äútonic‚Äù sound.</p>

<p>Here, we can notice that the dominant notes (the top 4 notes of a extended dominant chord) form a <em>diminished</em> chord. And since a diminished chords is built on minor thirds, it stays constant in any inversion.</p>

<p>Finally, all we have to do now is move between the tonic sound and the dominant sound. This can be done quickly, too. For example if you‚Äôre playing a descending scale, you can alternate the harmany on each step to create a nice &amp; rich feeling of tension &amp; release.</p>
