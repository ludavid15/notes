    <p>A collection of lessons I‚Äôve learned about working effectively. Before going any further, let me establish that the notes here are for myself. I don‚Äôt know if any of these tactics would work well for someone else. I think most people arrive at their own version of the truth in different ways. There are hundreds (thousands?) of ‚Äúself-improvement‚Äù books out there, so it‚Äôs not like the world needs a another one. I‚Äôve gone through a few myself with mixed success. Sometimes there‚Äôs no way to learn a lesson until an event really makes it sinks in, and a strategy you once thought was silly suddenly makes a lot more sense.</p>

    <p>A collection of writing tips. If you‚Äôre serious about writing, I‚Äôd recommend reading <em>On Writing Well</em> by William Zinsser.</p>
