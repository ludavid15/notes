    <p>Reliability engineering aims to understand the probability of success over time. It is heavily based in probability and statistics.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I‚Äôve had the chance to lead a number of different teams. This post is a collection of things I‚Äôve learned so far, as well as my own thoughts on what makes an effective leader.</p>

    <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2023</span>
    <p>In the frontend post, we explored React and how to build a dynamic website with it. Now let‚Äôs focus on developing a full stack application, using React for the frontend, and AWS to support the backend. This is a bit of a work in progress, and presents only one way to do this. There are alot more tools available, and depending on the requirements of your site you may choose a different architecture entirely.</p>

    <p>Join me as I document the things I learn while developing a custom application! I‚Äôm starting with a frontend, which is the code that is a user interface. The frontend connects the user (via buttons and pretty images) to the backend (the business logic).</p>

    <p>Finally we‚Äôre getting to stuff that I work with. There‚Äôs a lot to know when it comes to satellites, so in this post we‚Äôre just going to stick to the basics.</p>

    <span class="post-date">09 Dec 2022</span>
    <p>With better computers, engineers have increasingly turned to model based systems engineering, or MBSE as a solution to the engineering process. After all, things like CAD, CFD, and FEM have enabled us to model complex physics, so why not model a project?</p>

    <p>If you‚Äôve ever tried to manage a highly complex project, you know that a certain amount of organization is required. This kind of big-picture planning helps to reduce risk. However, it‚Äôs important to remember that this kind of oversight ultimately serves the product. There is such a thing as too much management.</p>

    <p>In contrast to data <em>science</em>, which designs and explores the models and algorithms we have for analyzing data, data <em>analytics</em> is about using data to solve problems. This includes additional steps like considering your stakeholders, communicating ideas, and working under a deadline. If you want to read about machine learning, check out the <a href="/notes/mlintroduction/">introduction to machine learning post</a>.</p>
