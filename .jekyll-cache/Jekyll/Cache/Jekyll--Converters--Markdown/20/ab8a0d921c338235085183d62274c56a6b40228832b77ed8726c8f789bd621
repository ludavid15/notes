I"n<p>If you‚Äôve ever tried to manage a highly complex project, you know that a certain amount of organization is required. This kind of big-picture planning helps to reduce risk. However, it‚Äôs important to remember that this kind of oversight ultimately serves the product. Otherwise, project management easily devolves into beaurocracy.</p>

<p>This is the balance to be struck in the world of systems engineering. Systems engineering is a set of practices for developing highly complex projects while minimizing risk. It is NOT a substitute for good communication or for responsible people (though it can help).</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>Requirements have been the backbone of aerospace systems engineering for a few decades now. The basic idea is that we write down a complete list of everything our project needs to do, and then break them down piece by piece. The idea is sound, but the execution gets messy very quickly, and is more art than science.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs consider an example. Say we are trying to design a rocketship to Mars. We might define a few high level requirements that read:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The rocket shall carry 4 astronauts</li>
  <li>The rocket shall be able to complete the mission in 2 years.</li>
  <li>The rocket shall use electric propulsion systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>Taking the first requirement, we can break it down logically into necessary components. This process then gets repeated over and over until we reach a good level of detail, or more likely, until we can‚Äôt be bothered to keep going.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The rocket shall include a life support system to recycle oxygen.</li>
  <li>The rocket shall include 5000 cubic feet of living space for the astronauts.</li>
  <li>The rocket shall carry 3000 lbs of food and living equipment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once all the requirements have been written, design work begins. The engineers build the rocketship exactly to spec, ahead of schedule and under budget, and then we fly to Mars. Err, ok maybe not. Before we launch we need to validate and verify that everything is good to go.</p>

<h3 id="validation-and-verification">Validation and Verification</h3>

<p>The process of ensuring the design meets the expectation is known as the validation and verification step. <strong>Verification</strong> checks to see that the design satisfies the exact wording of the requirement. For example, we can measure the interior space of our rocket, and if we find that there is indeed 5000 cubic feet, we have verified that requirement. <strong>Validation</strong> checks that we‚Äôre meeting the spirit of the requirement. In this case, the intent of this requirement is to provide astronauts with enough living space, but is 5000 really enough? What if the 5000 cubic feet is in the form of a 1 ft x 1 ft x 5000 ft narrow tube? Such a design would not meet the intent of the requirement, even though technically it satisfied the exact wording.</p>

<p>There aren‚Äôt really any rules on how a requirement should be written, but usually requirements do one of three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define some desired function/feature (ex: shall send telemetry)</li>
  <li>Define how well something has to be done (ex: shall be operational up to 100 deg)</li>
  <li>Define an aspect of the design (ex: shall operate at 30V)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="why-requirements">Why Requirements?</h4>

<p>My personal opinion of requirements is that they exist as a document of wants, agreed upon by the stakeholders. If I want or need A, I‚Äôll go to you, we can talk it over, and we write this down into our requirements document.</p>

<p>This may be a good way to track our needs, (potentially comparable to ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù from agile), but I think we shouldn‚Äôt imagine requirements to be a good model of your design. In other words, it‚Äôs important for your model to meet the requirements, but the requirements are not for organizing your design.</p>
