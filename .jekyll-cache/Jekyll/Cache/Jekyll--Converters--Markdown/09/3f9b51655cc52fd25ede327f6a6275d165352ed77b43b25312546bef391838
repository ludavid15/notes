I"Å<p>The ground track of a satellite is its orbit projected into the surface. I‚Äôd recommend checking out the post on <a href="/notes/astrodynamics/">astrodynamics</a> first, which gives a basic overview of how orbits work.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>To start, here are the three parameters which we can use to define an orbit in the Earth Centered Interial frame. These function like a set of rotation angles which relate the orbital/perifocal frame to the ECI frame.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inclination</li>
  <li>Right Ascension of the Ascending Node</li>
  <li>Argument of Periapsis</li>
</ul>

<p>And then within the perifocal frame, the position/radius along the orbit is defined as a function of the true anomaly as:</p>

\[r = \frac{h^2}{\mu}\frac{1}{1+ecos(\theta)}\]

<p>Let‚Äôs also think about the position in the perifocal frame as a vector. In polar coordinates, this is just \(r\) and \(\theta\), but what about in cartesian coordinates? Well, something like this:</p>

\[r_{perifocal} = \begin{bmatrix} r cos(\theta) \\ r sin(\theta) \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>At this point, we can write a couple of rotation matrices to get from the perifocal frame to the ECI frame. The order of rotations is going to be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rotate about Z by the argument of periapsis \((\omega)\).</li>
  <li>Rotate about X by the inclination \((i)\).</li>
  <li>Rotate about Z by the right ascenrion of the ascending node \((\Omega)\).</li>
</ol>

  <p>Linear Algebra Question - what type of matrix is a rotation matrix?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mathematically, this is going to be written as:</p>

\[r_{ECI} = R(\omega) \cdot R(i) \cdot R(\Omega) \cdot r_{perifocal}\]

<p>Finally, we‚Äôll want to convert from ECI to ECEF. This is going to be a rotation about the Z axis. The angle is going to vary depending on the time.</p>

\[r_{ECEF} = R(GMST) \cdot r_{ECI}\]

<p>If we represent this ECEF position vector in spherical coordinates, we can take the radial and azimuth angles which will give us our longitude and latitude. All said and done, we‚Äôll have an expression for the ground track of our satellite as a function of the orbital parameters, time, and true anomaly. Keep in mind that the specific ground track on a 2D map might look different, depending on the type of projection used.</p>

<h3 id="a-qualitative-perspective">A Qualitative Perspective</h3>

<p>An exact mathematical expression is great, but it doesn‚Äôt offer very much in the way of visual intuition. We‚Äôd like to know how different parameters affect the ground track‚Äôs shape. To start, let‚Äôs clarify that while ground tracks are periodic, they aren‚Äôt sinusoids. Nonetheless, we can still think about them with features like a ‚Äúperiod‚Äù and ‚Äúamplitude‚Äù.</p>

<h3 id="inclination">Inclination</h3>

<p>The inclination defines the maximum (and also minimum) latitude reached by the ground track. (Remember that the inclination is the same measured from both above and below the equator). You also can‚Äôt launch into a lower inclination orbit than the latitude of your launch site, hence why equatorial launch sites are very popular.</p>

<h3 id="orbital-period">Orbital Period</h3>

<p>The orbital period defines the ‚Äúwavelength/frequency‚Äù of your ground track. However, we need to keep in mind that the Earth is also rotating. This means that on sequential orbits, we do not return to the same place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre in a 2 hour LEO orbit. After we complete 1 orbit, the Earth will have rotated by 360 * (1/12) = 30 degrees. This means on every orbit, we‚Äôll cross the equator at a longitude that‚Äôs shifted 30 degrees.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="eccentricity">Eccentricity</h3>

<p>The ground track of a circular orbit is symmetric about the equator. But if your orbit is elliptical, the track is going to change between the northern and southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>But how exactly does it change? Well we know that for an elliptical orbit, we travel slowly at apogee, and quickly at perigee. In ground track terms, this means we don‚Äôt cover a lot of ground at apogee, but we <em>do</em> cover a lot of ground at Perigee. Thus the ground track is going to be more ‚Äúcompact‚Äù under apogee, and more ‚Äúspread out‚Äù under Perigee.</p>

<h3 id="apparent-retrograde">Apparent Retrograde</h3>

<p>There‚Äôs a magical altitude at which the period of our orbit is exactly equal to the 24 hours. This is called a <em>Geostationary</em> orbit, because satellites at this position appear to be stationary relative to the surface of the Earth.</p>

<p>But what if the satellite is even further out? In this case, it is moving slower than the rotation of the Earth, and from an observer on the ground it‚Äôs actually going to look like it‚Äôs moving backwards (i.e.g East to West). This is also called apparent retrograde, where the satellite is still technically in a prograde orbit, it just appears to be in retrograde from the ground.</p>

<p>Now that you get the idea, I want to caveat that we don‚Äôt <em>have</em> to be strictly higher than GEO altitudes for this to happen. We could be in a highly elliptical orbit, and around the apogee of that orbit, we could be orbiting slower than the rotation of the Earth.</p>
