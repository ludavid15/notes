I"„<p>A collection of lessons Iâ€™ve learned about working effectively. Before going any further, let me establish that the notes here are for myself. I donâ€™t know if any of these tactics would work well for someone else. I think most people arrive at their own version of the truth in different ways. There are hundreds (thousands?) of â€œself-improvementâ€ books out there, so itâ€™s not like the world needs a another one. Iâ€™ve gone through a few myself with mixed success. Sometimes thereâ€™s no way to learn a lesson until an event really makes it sinks in, and a strategy you once thought was silly suddenly makes a lot more sense.</p>
