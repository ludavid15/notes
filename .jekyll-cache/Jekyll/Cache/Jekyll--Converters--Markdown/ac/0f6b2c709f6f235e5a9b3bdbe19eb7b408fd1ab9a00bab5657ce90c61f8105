    <p>There is so much literature out there on machine learning that it can get pretty overwhelming. This post serves to organize machine learning into a few broad categories, and in doing so, highlight their different strengths.</p>

    <p>The underlying principle of an optimization is pretty straightfoward - find the best way to do something. Best can mean fastest, safest, most efficient, shortest or thousands of other things, but the common denominator is that we are looking for the most (or least) of something. Mathematically then, this is pretty simple: weâ€™re solving for a maximum.</p>

    <p>At its core, machine learning is a <strong>statistical science</strong>, and like most elements of statistics, a great deal of care must be taken when formatting and analyzing data. They way we chose to quantify abstract topics and/or measure error will have a significant impact on the quality of our result.</p>
