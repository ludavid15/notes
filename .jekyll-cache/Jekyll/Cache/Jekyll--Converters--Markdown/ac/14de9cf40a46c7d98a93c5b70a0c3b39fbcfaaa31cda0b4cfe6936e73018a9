    <p>This post explores a variety of tried and tested approaches to music generation with deep learning. Although each example can stand alone in theory, they are presented in an order that gradually introduces new concepts and challenges. As we go through each example, we will tag the challenges which apply to each one.</p>

    <p>There are two ways in which artifical intelligence has been applied to music. The first is called music information retrieval, or MIR for short. These programs produce data from audio (e.g. song identification, transcribing audio into sheet music). The second is known as <em>generative</em> AI. These programs try to produce new and original music, either fully autonomously or as a predictive aid to composers (i.e. like text predits on your phone!).</p>

        Chord Progressions

    <p>A collection of common chord progressions I‚Äôve encountered. Though they come in all sorts of flavors and styles, many progressions are built on the idea of <strong>tension</strong> and <strong>release</strong>. We play dissonant chords to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the melody towards a nice resolution, which usually is the tonic chord (also known as the home chord).</p>

        Twelve Tone Equal Temperatment

    <p>If you‚Äôve taken any kind of music lesson before, chances are you were introduced to the western classical system of notation, otherwise known as twelve-tone equal temperament. In this system, each octave is subdivided into 12 notes, labeled A through G.</p>

<p>So much of music theory is based on this system that it‚Äôs easy to forget what it is - a constructed language that approximates something physical.</p>
