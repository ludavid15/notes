I"ä<h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>

<p>This is my personal website where I document things I have learned. Some of these are a direct copy of my notes from school, while others are more thought out like a blog post. The purpose of this site is twofold - both as a way for me to remember things, and as a place for me to write about new topics to help my learning.</p>

<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>I have both a B.S and M.S in aerospace engineering, completed at UCLA in 2019 and the University of Michigan in 2021 respectively. My masterâ€™s thesis was an exploration of image processing and image segmentation on ultrasonic scans of composite laminate panels for impact damage analysis. Right now Iâ€™m a systems engineer at Northrop Grumman, where I model and design satellite architectures.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m curious about a lot of things, but at the moment, Iâ€™m thinking mostly about space systems engineering, agile product management, music theory, and machine learning.</p>

<p>Please bear with me as I continue to add features! To-do-list: hyperlinks, more pictures, fix equations.</p>

<p>This website uses the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a> theme for <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Check it out!</p>
