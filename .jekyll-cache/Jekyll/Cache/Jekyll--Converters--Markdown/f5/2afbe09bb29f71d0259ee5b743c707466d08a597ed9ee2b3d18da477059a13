I"ƒ<p>To be clear, when we talk about fluid mechanics, we arenâ€™t just talking about the second state of matter (liquid \(\subset\) fluid). It honestly would make a lot more sense if we called it â€œflow mechanicsâ€, but too many textbooks have been printed now to change that. In any case, weâ€™re stuck with the term fluid mechanics, so thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll be working with here.</p>
