I"9<p>A collection of common chord progressions I’ve encountered. Though they come in all sorts of flavors and styles, many progressions are built on the idea of <strong>tension</strong> and <strong>release</strong>. We play dissonant chords to “push” the melody towards a nice resolution, which usually is the tonic chord (also known as the home chord).</p>

<h4 id="minor-2-5-1">Minor 2-5-1</h4>

<p>It’s the same chord progression, but this is the minor version. The <strong>ii</strong> which is normally a minor 7th, becomes a diminished</p>

<h4 id="extended-3-6-2-5-1">Extended 3-6-2-5-1</h4>

<p>Sometimes also known as the Barry Harris progression,</p>
