I"j<p>The underlying principle of an optimization is pretty straightfoward - find the best way to do something. Best can mean fastest, safest, most efficient, shortest or thousands of other things, but the common denominator is that we are looking for the most (or least) of something. Mathematically then, this is pretty simple: weâ€™re solving for a maximum.</p>
