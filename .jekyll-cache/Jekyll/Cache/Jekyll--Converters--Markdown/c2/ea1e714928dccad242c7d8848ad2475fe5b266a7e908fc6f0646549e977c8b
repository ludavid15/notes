I"§<p>A random assortment of communications technology terms Iâ€™ve encountered over the years. Please keep in mind that electrical engineering and signal processing is <em>not</em> one of my subjects, so take everything here with a grain of salt.</p>

<h4 id="ml-std-1553">ML-STD 1553</h4>

<p>A traffic control protocol for managing information traffic from multiple sources on a shared physical line. 1553 requires a controlling bus computer (BC) and an addresses for each terminal. The underlying constraint of 1553 is that traffic is never parrallel. In other words, each terminal takes turns using the line, and ignores any information on the line while not actively in use. On any given 1553 line, there can be up to 31 <em>remote terminals</em> (RTs), each with their own <em>subaddresses</em>. Data transmission can happen in pretty much any direction:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Controller to RT</li>
  <li>RT to Controller</li>
  <li>RT to RT</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being an older protocol, 1553 only has a bandwidth of around 1 Mbps</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ethernet">Ethernet</h3>

<p>Ethernet is another communications protocol, defined at the physical layer and data link layer. In contrast to 1553 which uses a shared bus topology, ethernet supports direct transmission paths between devices. The data link layer has two different aspects. Thereâ€™s the Logical Link Control (LLC) and the Media Access Control (MAC).</p>

<p>There are also two transmission modes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Half Duplex - transmission is only allowed in 1 direction at any given moment.</li>
  <li>Full Duplex - transmission is allowed in both directions at once.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Standard ethernet has bandwidths of 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps, or 10 Gbps.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="rs-422">RS-422</h3>

<p>A point to point interface which transmits digital/bi-level information by changing the difference in voltage between two lines. This allows for higher data rates and lower noise in comparison to a single voltage line because we can achieve the same total change in the difference with only half the voltage change in each line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RS422 has a typical bandwitch of up to 10 Mbps</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="traveling-wave-tube-amplifier">Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier</h4>

<p>Often abbreviated to just TWTA, this is a device used for amplifying radio signals. Satellites often need this since they communicate over large distances.</p>

<h3 id="message-securityintegrity">Message Security/Integrity</h3>

<p>Besides protocols and hardware to manage communications, weâ€™d should also think about ways to ensure security and check the integrity of what we communicate.</p>

<p>An easy one to start with is Parity. This is a single bit which tells you if there is an even or odd number of 1â€™s in the transmitted signal. We can use this to check the integrity of a message.</p>
