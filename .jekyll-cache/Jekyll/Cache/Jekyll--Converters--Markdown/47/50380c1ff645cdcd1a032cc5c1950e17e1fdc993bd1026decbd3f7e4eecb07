    <p>In practice, machine learning algorithsm can be tricky to setup and tune. This post discusses the different metrics you can use to evaluate your algorithm, and how to fine-tine your setup based on how those metrics perform.</p>

    <p>At its core, machine learning is a <strong>statistical science</strong>, and like statistics, a great deal of care must be taken when formatting and analyzing data. They way we chose to quantify abstract topics and/or measure error will have a significant impact on the quality of our result.</p>

    <p>Across the vast field of robotics and controls, there is a common question of ‚Äúhow do we get from point A to point B?‚Äù. Without any constraints, the answer is pretty easy - go in a straight line - but this is not very useful. So how can we formulate a more useful question?</p>

    <p>In this article, we learn how to frame a trajectory problem as a mathematical optimization problem. Keep in mind that this is only one way to solve plan a trajectory. To begin, let‚Äôs connect the physical properties of a trajectory, to the inputs of any optimization problem.</p>

    <p>There is so much literature out there on machine learning that it can get pretty overwhelming. This post introduces machine learning one concept at a time, without getting into any math.</p>

    <p>The underlying principle of an optimization is pretty straightfoward - find the best way to do something. Best can mean fastest, safest, most efficient, shortest or thousands of other things, but the common denominator is that we are looking for the most (or least) of something. Mathematically then, this is pretty simple: we‚Äôre solving for a maximum.</p>
