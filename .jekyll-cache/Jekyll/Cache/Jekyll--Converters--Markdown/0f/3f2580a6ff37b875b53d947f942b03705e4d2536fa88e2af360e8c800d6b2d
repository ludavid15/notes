I"Ô<p>There is so much literature out there on machine learning that it can get pretty overwhelming. This post serves to organize machine learning into a few broad categories, and in doing so, highlight their different strengths.</p>

<p>Before going further, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that many machine learning algorithms are built using optimization. There is almost always something to be optimized (an objective function - error, fitness, etc.), and different ways to run the optimization (genetic, linear, quadratic, etc.). Different algorithms may change the problem, but the name of the game remains the same.</p>

<h3 id="supervised-learning">Supervised Learning</h3>

<p>Supervised learning algorithms are used when you know the type of output you want, but need to learn the function that will get you there. These algorithms are often implemented with deep neural networks, and are useful for classification tasks. As the name implies, this method absolutely requires having a labeled dataset. If your problem doesn‚Äôt readily accept labels, this strategy will probably fall short. Try instead to identify if parts of the solution involve identification.</p>

<h3 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised Learning</h3>

<p>Unsupervised learning algorithms discover patterns in your data. Note that these algorithms are NOT classification algorithms. Instead, they tell you what the likely categories are. In this sense, they are a lot like the statistical regression methods you may have have encountered in high school. Depending on the structure of your data, there are many different strategies which fall under this umbrella, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>K-means Clustering</li>
  <li>Singular Value Decomposition</li>
  <li>Independent Component Analysis</li>
  <li>Autoencoders</li>
</ul>

<p>Another way to understand unsupervised learning algorithms is that they look for ways to compress your data. If you had fifty (x,y) coordinates which all fall onto the line y = 3x+2, an unsupervised learning algorithm can compress those 100 numbers into fifty x-coordinates and a function. See how we‚Äôve reduced the total datasize? If you‚Äôve ever compressed an image or a word document, you‚Äôve made use of an unsupervised learning technique.</p>

<h3 id="reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement Learning</h3>

<p>Improvement through natural selection is the general idea of reinforcement learning. For some problems, success is measured by a distant goal, or by some cumulative performance. In these cases, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to define individual state variables. Here is where reinforcement learning comes in.</p>

<h3 id="knowledge-base-or-symbolic-ai">Knowledge Base or Symbolic AI</h3>

<p>Although other algorithms perform well enough, they don‚Äôt gain any real ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù about what they‚Äôre doing, at least, not in the same capacity as you and me. A convolutional neural network that classifies cats from dogs, would not be able to transfer any intuition to a similar task, like classifying goats from cows.</p>
