I"ˆ<p>There is so much literature out there on machine learning that it can get pretty overwhelming. This post serves to organize machine learning into a few broad categories, and in doing so, highlight their different strengths.</p>

<h3 id="supervised-learning">Supervised Learning</h3>

<p>Supervised learning algorithms are used when you know the type of output you want, but need to learn the function that will get you there. These algorithms are often implemented with deep neural networks, and are useful for classification tasks. As the name implies, this method absolutely requires having a labeled dataset. If your problem doesnâ€™t readily accept labels, this strategy will probably fall short. Try instead to identify if parts of the solution involve identification.</p>

<h3 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised Learning</h3>

<p>Unsupervised learning algorithms discover patterns in your data. Note that these algorithms are NOT classification algorithms. Instead, they tell you what the likely categories are. In this sense, they are a lot like the statistical regression methods you may have have encountered in high school.</p>
