I"<p>Although there are many interpretations of Bayes Theorem, let’s start with this one: Bayes Theory gives us a way to update a prediction based on observation of new evidence.</p>

<h3 id="basic-mathematical-statement">Basic Mathematical Statement</h3>

<p>The probability of A given B, is equal to the probability of B given A, times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.</p>

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\]
