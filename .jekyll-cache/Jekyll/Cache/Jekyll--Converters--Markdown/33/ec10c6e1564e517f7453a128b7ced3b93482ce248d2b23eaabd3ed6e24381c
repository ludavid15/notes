        Chord Progressions

    <p>A collection of common chord progressions I’ve encountered.

    <p>If you’ve taken any kind of music lesson before, chances are you were introduced to the western classical system of notation, otherwise known as twelve-tone equal temperament. In this system, each octave is subdivided into 12 notes, labeled A through G.</p>

<p>So much of music theory is based on this system that it’s easy to forget what it is - a constructed language that approximates something physical.</p>
