I"=<p>In dynamics, the goal is to predict the position, velocity, and acceleration of rigid bodies as a function of time through the use of Newtonâ€™s second law, F=ma. While the basic principle is simple, the key challenge of dynamics involves the definition of reference frames, vectors, and their relationships.</p>
