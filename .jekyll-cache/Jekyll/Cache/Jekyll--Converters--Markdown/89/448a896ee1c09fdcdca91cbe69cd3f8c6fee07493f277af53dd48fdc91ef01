<h3 id="section-1---matrices">Section 1 - Matrices</h3>

<p><strong>Vector</strong> - By default, vectors are columns. The transpose/Hermitian of a vector turns it into a row.</p>

<p><strong>Range/Span</strong> - The set of all linear combinations of each vector.</p>

\[R\left(A\right)={\alpha_1A_1+a_2A_2\ldots+\alpha_kA_k,\ for\ any\ \alpha_i\in F}\]

<p><strong>Nullspace/Kernel (of a matrix A)</strong> - The set of all vectors \(\vec{x}\) such that Ax = 0</p>

\[N\left(A\right)={x\in F^n,\ Ax=0}\]

<p><strong>Ortho-complement (of a subspace)</strong> -  The set of all vectors \(\vec{x}\) that are orthogonal to all vectors in the subspace V.</p>

\[V^\bot={x,\ x\bot y\ for\ all\ y\in V}\]

<p><strong>Linear Dependence</strong> - A set of vectors are said to linearly dependent if there exist scalars \(\alpha\) not all zero such that:</p>

\[\alpha_1V_1+a_2V_2\ldots+\alpha_kV_k=0\]

<p><strong>Rank</strong> - The rank of a matrix is the is the number of linearly independent rows or columns. It is equal to the dimension of the span of the matrix. The rank cannot be greater than min(m, n) given \(A\in F^{m\times n}\).</p>

<h3 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h3>

<p>The singular value decomposition of a matrix [A] yields the following expression, where  U\in F^{m\times m} is the matrix of left singular vector, V\in F^{n\times n} is the matrix of right singular vectors, and the strictly positive entries of \Sigma\in F^{m\times n} are referred to singular values. The number of nonzero singular values equals the rank of [A]. Both U and V are unitary matrixes.</p>

\[A\in F^{m\times n}=U\Sigma V^H\]

<p>Realizing that in some cases, the rank of A is less than either m or n, leaving a few zero entries along the singular values. These send corresponding vectors in U and V to zero, and thus A can be reassembled with only the vectors of U, V and singular values through (r).</p>

\[A=\ \sum_{i=1}^{r}{\sigma_iu_iv_i^H}\]

<h3 id="orthogonal-projection-matrix">Orthogonal Projection Matrix</h3>

<p>Consider a set of vectors \(v_1,\ v_2,\ \ldots v_k\) which form an orthonormal basis for the subspace of some range V. The orthogonal projection matrix of the subspace V as well as the orthocomplement of V is formed as:</p>

\[P_v=Q_kQ_k^H\]

\[P_{v^\bot}={I-Q}_kQ_k^H\]

<p>The orthogonal projection matrix when multiplied by a vector finds the projection of that vector onto the subspace and is equal to subtraction of any orthogonal components from the original vector. That is:</p>

\[P_{v^\bot}x=x-P_vx\]

<h3 id="pseudo-inverse-moore-penrose-inverse">Pseudo-Inverse (Moore-Penrose Inverse)</h3>

<p>Note that a non-square matrix cannot be inverted in the traditional sense. However, it is still possible to achieve a partial inverse by using the SVD. We define the pseudo inverse as:</p>

\[A^+=V\Sigma^+U^H\]

\[\Sigma^+=\left[\begin{matrix}\Sigma_{r\times r}&amp;0_{r,\ n-r}\\0_{m\times r,\ r}&amp;0_{m-r,\ n-r}\\\end{matrix}\right]\ \in F^{n\times m}\]

<h3 id="least-squares-regressionordinary-least-squares">Least Squares Regression/Ordinary Least Squares</h3>

<p>Given a problem stated in the following format, it is possible to find an exact solution.</p>

\[x_{LS}=argmin\|Ax-b\|_2^2\]

\[x_{LS}=A^+b\]

<p>Thus, we may be generally motivated to format our problems in the above format, such that a solution can be easily solved using the pseudo-inverse. Consider a dataset of inputs and corresponding outputs, denoted as t and b.</p>

<p>Our approximation function we would like to take the form:</p>

\[b_j=c_1+c_2t_j+c_3t_j^2+ \ldots Î±_1cos(t_j)+Î²_1sin(t_j)+Î±_2cos(t_j)+Î²_2sin(t_j)+ \ldots\]

<p>This can be represented in a linear format by defining the following sets of A and x matrices.</p>

\[x=\ \left[c_1,\ c_2,c_3,\ldots,\ \alpha_1,\beta_1,\alpha_2,\beta_2,\ \ldots\right]^T\]

\[A_j=[1,\ t_j,\ t_j^2, \ldots,\cos(t_j),\sin(t_j),\cos(t_j),\sin(t_j)]\]

<p>Thus, the dot product of x with Aj should yield Equation 1. Repeating the above for every data point will yield a full matrix for A. The coefficients for our model equation which best fit the data can be found now using least squares regression.</p>

<h3 id="regularized-least-squares">Regularized Least Squares</h3>

<p>Consider for a moment, a constrained least squares problem:</p>

\[x_{LS}=argmin\|Ax-b\|_2^2\]

\[\|Dx\|_2&lt;Ï„\]

<p>As we did in optimization, we can include the constraint, as something that should be included in the weighting of the objective function.</p>

\[x_{LS}=argmin\|Ax-b\|_2^2+Î»^2\|Dx\|_2^2\]

<p>We can be reformed into our classic least squares problem format by defining the following sets of matrices:</p>

\[\widetilde{A}=\left[\begin{matrix}A\\\lambda D\\\end{matrix}\right],\ \widetilde{b}=\left[\begin{matrix}b\\0\\\end{matrix}\right]\]

\[x_{LS}=argmin\|Ax-b\|_2^2\]

<h3 id="first-difference-matrix">First Difference Matrix</h3>

<p>The first difference matrix when multiplied by a vector yields the elementwise gradients (taking the spacing/index to be the x displacement).</p>

\[D=\ \left[\begin{matrix}-1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;-1&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;\vdots&amp;\ddots&amp;\vdots&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;-1&amp;1\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;-1\\\end{matrix}\right]\]

<h3 id="trace-of-a-matrix">Trace of a Matrix</h3>

<p>The trace of a matrix is defined as the sum of values down the primary diagonal. The trace is invariant under cyclic permutation:</p>

\[tr\left(AB\right)=tr\left(BA\right)\]

\[tr\left(A+B\right)=tr\left(A\right)+tr\left(B\right)\]

<h3 id="frobenius-norm">Frobenius Norm</h3>

<p>The Frobenius norm of a matrix is the root of the sum of the square of all values. The frobenius norm is also equal to the square root of the trace, and the sum of square of singular values of A.</p>

\[\|A\|_F = a_{ij}^2\]

\[\|A\|_F^2=tr(AA^H)=tr(A^HA)=Ïƒ_i^2\]

<h3 id="principal-component-analysis">Principal Component Analysis</h3>

<p>Consider a matrix whose columns represent different items in a dataset, and whose rows represent different parameters for each data item (i.e. x, y, z, coordinates). Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, finds an orthonormal basis of directions which best fit the data. These lines minimize the average squared distance of each point to the line. This orthonormal basis are also the left singular vectors obtained through SVD.</p>

<p>The first principal component of a matrix A, associated with the first eigenvector/left singular vector of the eigen decomposition and SVD, can be found as the vector which maximizes the second norm of the product of A with x.</p>

\[u_1=\ argmax\|Ax\|^2)\]

<p>The next largest principal component can be found by projecting A into the null space formed from the previously found vectors and repeating the previous calculation. (We are finding the next line of best fit that is orthonormal to any previously found lines).</p>

<h3 id="independent-component-analysis">Independent Component Analysis</h3>

<p>ICA decomposes a signal into independent (non-correlated) non-Gaussian signals. When sources are statistically independent, ICA works very well in separating the two. ICA methods tend to breakdown when there is similarity in the signal, leading to correlation. To do this, ICA identifies directions that maximize absolute kurtosis. Mathematically, this is:</p>

\[x=\ argmax(|k_4(x^TA)|)\]

<p>Where Kurtosis, or the fourth central cumulant, is defined as:</p>

\[k_4(y^T)=\frac{1}{n}\sum y_i^4- 3(\frac{1}{n} \sum y_i^2)^2\]

<p>And in addition, subject to a spherical constraint on the x input (i.e., two norm of x is equal to 1).</p>

\[\|x\|_2^2=1\]

<h3 id="procrustes-analysis">Procrustes Analysis</h3>

<p>A method for statistical analysis of shape distributions. An orthogonal Procrustes problem is one that finds the optimal rotation, translation, and/or reflection which aligns two shapes.</p>

<h3 id="minimum-dimensions">Minimum Dimensions</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I told you that there were 4 distinct points, and gave you the distance between every pair, you could determine the minimum dimensional space required to properly map these points. For instance, if all 6 distances are the same, there is no way to position these 4 points in a plane that makes this true. Instead, they must be arranged as a regular tetrahedron in 3D space.</p>
