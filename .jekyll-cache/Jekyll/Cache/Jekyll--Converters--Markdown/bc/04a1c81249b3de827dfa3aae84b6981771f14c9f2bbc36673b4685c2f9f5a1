I"À<p>Unlike solids, fluids deform constantly under stress (in other words, a fluid <strong>flows</strong>). How it flows is very much dependent on itâ€™s <strong>viscosity</strong>.</p>

<p class="message">
Viscosity is to fluids what the modulus of elasticity is to solids. It relates the stress (amount of force) to strain (amount of deformation). Qualitatively, viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistence to flowing. Things like honey have a very high viscosity, while air and water have comparatively lower viscosity. 
</p>

<p>Viscous flow is the study of how a fluidâ€™s viscosity affects its behavior. Viscous flow covers topics like boundary layers, low-speed flows, and small-scale flows. Coincidentally, the regimes in which viscous forces dominate is often incompressible, but this is not a hard and fast rule.</p>

<h3 id="viscosity">Viscosity</h3>

<p>The viscosity of a fluid $\mu$ defines the relationship between stress and strain. In most cases, we assume that the fluid is a Newtonian Fluid, meaning its stress and strain are related linearly. Here it is in two dimensions:</p>

\[\tau=\mu\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\right)\]

\[Friction\ Force=\mu\nabla^2\vec{V}=\nabla\tau\]

<p>We can also define the second coefficient of viscosity as Î».</p>

\[\xi=\lambda+\frac{2}{3}\mu\]

<h3 id="reynolds-number">Reynoldâ€™s Number</h3>

<p>The ratio between viscous forces and inertial forces. The lower the Reynoldâ€™s number, the more dominant viscous effects become. The Reynoldâ€™s number can also show when a flow transitions from laminar to turbulent flow. Where Âµ is the dynamic viscosity.</p>

\[Re=\ \frac{\rho U_\infty L}{\mu}\]

<p>At very low Re, we get the Stokes equations. At very high Re, we get the Euler equations (potential flow theory).</p>

<h3 id="low-reynolds-number-flow-stokes-flow">Low Reynoldâ€™s Number Flow (Stokesâ€™ Flow)</h3>

<p>This is the exact opposite regime of potential flow theory, in which viscous forces dominate over inertia forces. This is usually associated with low velocity, small scale, or highly viscous flows. Some applications can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fully developed duct flow</li>
  <li>Flow about immersed bodies (i.e. small particle dynamics)</li>
  <li>Lubrication theory</li>
  <li>Flow through porous media (mostly used for civil engineering)</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the above assumption, the momentum equation reduces to the following:</p>

\[\nabla P\approx\mu\nabla^2V\]

<h3 id="low-reynolds-number-flow-over-a-sphere">Low Reynoldâ€™s Number Flow Over a Sphere</h3>

<p>By solving stokes equations with the boundary conditions for viscous flow past a sphere, the following stream function can be calculated:</p>

\[\psi=\frac{1}{4}Ua^2{sin}^2(\theta)\left[\frac{a}{r}-\frac{3r}{a}+\frac{2r^2}{a^2}\right]\]

<p>This can be compared to the stream function found by applying potential flow theory about a sphere:</p>

\[\psi=\frac{1}{2}Ur^2{sin}^2(\theta)\left[1-\frac{a^3}{r^3}\right]\]

<p>Solving the first equation for shear and pressure drag, we find an expression for the total drag on a sphere in the low Reynoldâ€™s number limit:</p>

\[F=4\pi\mu Ua+2\pi\mu Ua\]

<p>Where the first term is the viscous contribution to drag, and the second term is the pressure contribution to drag. This is normalized by the area and dynamic pressure to find the drag coefficient.</p>

\[C_d=\frac{2F}{\rho U^2\pi a^2}=\frac{24}{Re}\]

<p>This equation underpredicts drag for Reynoldâ€™s numbers larger than 1, since separation and wakes introduce greater pressure drag.</p>

<h3 id="steady-flow-between-infinite-plates">Steady Flow between Infinite Plates</h3>

<p>A class of problem in which viscous forces dominate. We take the bottom plate to be stationary and assume some steady velocity for the top plate. There can also be a pressure gradient in the direction parallel to the plates.</p>

<p>In the limit that the top plateâ€™s velocity tends to zero we get a Hagen-Poiseuille flow problem (pressure gradient driven flow). In the limit that the pressure gradient tends to zero we get a Couette flow problem (velocity of the top plate drives flow). 
The general solution of the velocity profile is expressed below. The first equation is the general solution, while the second equation takes the lower wall to be stationary. Where Ï„o is the shear stress at the wall where y=0, and uo is the velocity at the wall where y=0.</p>

\[u\left(y\right)=\ -\frac{1}{2\mu}\left(-\frac{dP}{dx}\right)y^2+\frac{\tau_o}{\mu}y+u_o\]

\[u\left(y\right)=\ +\frac{1}{2\mu}\left(-\frac{dP}{dx}\right)y(h-y)+U\frac{y}{h}\]

<p>We can also solve for the volume flow rate per unit span by integrating over y.</p>

\[Q=U\frac{h}{2}+\frac{h^3}{12\mu}\left(-\frac{dP}{dx}\right)\]

<h3 id="unsteady-flow--infinite-plates">Unsteady Flow &amp; Infinite Plates</h3>

<p>There are two problems within this category, known as Stokes 1st problem (an impulsively started plate) and Stokesâ€™s 2nd problem (an oscillating plate).</p>

<h4 id="1st-problem">1st Problem:</h4>

<p>Stokeâ€™s first problem covers the scenario of an impulsively started plate.</p>

\[\frac{u(y,t)}{U}=1-\erf{\left(\frac{\eta}{2}\right)}\]

\[\erf{\left(x\right)}=\ \frac{2}{\sqrt\pi}\int_{0}^{x}{e^{-x^2}dx\]

\[\eta=\ \frac{y}{\sqrt{\nu t}}}\]

<p>As time increases, the penetration height will increase. At infinite time, the entire fluid moves with velocity U. The above solution represents a non-dimensionalized solution, where Î· represents the ratio of position to penetration height scaling.</p>

<h4 id="2nd-problem">2nd Problem:</h4>

<p>Motion of the bottom plate is defined as the following:</p>

\[U\left(t\right)=\ U_o\cos\funcapply(\omega t)\]

<p>The velocity profile above the plate and the stress at the wall can be solved to show the following:</p>

\[u\left(y,t\right)=U_oe^{-y\sqrt{\sfrac{\omega}{2v}}}cos\left(\omega t-y\sqrt{\sfrac{\omega}{2v}}\right)\]

\[\tau_{wall}=\mu\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=U_o\sqrt{\rho\mu\omega}sin\left(\omega t-\sfrac{\pi}{4}\right)\]

<p>The amplitude of the velocity oscillation decreases with distance from the plate. The ratio of viscosity to frequency determines the penetration height. Note that this ratio also affects a phase lead/lag, which changes with height, represented within the cosine term.</p>
