<h3 id="failure-rate">Failure Rate</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs say you perform some testing on 10 units for 100 hours each. By the end of that testing, 4 units failed, at [35, 47, 32, 41] hours. What would be the failure rate? Well, you‚Äôd divide the number of failures (in this case 4) by the total number of cycles that were run across all 10 units. This means the sum of 35 + 47 + 32 + 41, but also 6(100), which is the time that the other six units ran successfully without any failure.</p>

\[Failure Rate (\lambda) = \frac{Number of Failures}{Operating Time} = Failures Per Hour\]

<h3 id="inverse-of-the-failure-rate">Inverse of the Failure Rate</h3>

<p>Although the failure rate is easy to calculate from data, it‚Äôs not as useful for day to day planning. Instead, we often take the inverse of the failure rate, which gives us a much more intuitive value. The <strong>mean time to failure</strong> (MTTF) is the reliability index we use for non-repairable units. This goes for things like lightbulbs, where the part does not have anymore function after failing. In contrast, for repairable units (like your car), we use something called the <strong>mean time between failure</strong> (MTBF).</p>

\[MTTF (\theta) = \frac{Operating Time}{Number of Failures}\]

\[MTBF (\theta) = \frac{Operating Time}{Nuber of Failures}\]

\[\lambda = \frac{1}{\theta}\]

<h3 id="mean-time-to-recovery">Mean Time to Recovery</h3>

<p>Besides just how often a part may fail, we‚Äôre also interested in how long is takes to fix these failures. This leads us to the mean time to recovery. This is the average time it takes to restore normal operations after a failure has occured.</p>

<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve discussed the mean time between failure and the mean time to recover, we can combine these values into a new metric known as <em>availability</em>. You can think of this like a measure of the ‚Äúdown time‚Äù. Officially, availability is defined as the percentage of time which a system is ready/operational under normal circumstances. The availability is calculated as a fraction:</p>

\[A(t) = \frac{MTBF}{MTBF + MTTR}\]

<p>The above value is unitless, but you could multiply this value by 8760 for example (the number of hours in a year) to get an estimate for down time in a year.</p>

<h3 id="failure-modes-and-effects-analysis">Failure Modes and Effects Analysis</h3>

<p>Also known FMEA, or sometimes FMECA, this type of analysis aims to understand the ways in which parts fail, and any effects that failure would cause. It helps inform us where the highest risks are, and allows us to plan our risk mitigation strategy. High risk items can be those which fail often, or those that that have very severe consequences, or both!</p>
