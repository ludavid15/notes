    <p>In the previous post, we looked at how different architectures have been applied to music generation. But this is a bit like putting your cart before the horse, since we haven‚Äôt discussed in detail the kind of attributes we‚Äôre looking for. This post goes over some high level considerations - things that could serve as requirements for a project. Depending on your specific needs and desires, you may end up selecting a different architecture.</p>

    <p>DallE-2 and ChatGPT have come and shown us how powerful AI can be when it comes to abstract and creative tasks. If AI can create images and sentences, why not music?</p>

        Chord Progressions

    </h2>

    <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2021</span>
    <p>A collection of common chord progressions I‚Äôve encountered. Though they come in all sorts of flavors and styles, many progressions are built on the idea of <strong>tension</strong> and <strong>release</strong>. We play dissonant chords to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the melody towards a nice resolution, which usually is the tonic chord (also known as the home chord).</p>

        Twelve Tone Equal Temperatment

    <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2021</span>
    <p>If you‚Äôve taken any kind of music lesson before, chances are you were introduced to the western classical system of notation, otherwise known as twelve-tone equal temperament. In this system, each octave is subdivided into 12 notes, labeled A through G.</p>

<p>So much of music theory is based on this system that it‚Äôs easy to forget what it is - a constructed language that approximates something physical.</p>
