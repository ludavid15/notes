I"¹<p>Across the vast field of robotics and controls, there is a common question of â€œhow do we get from point A to point B?â€. Without any constraints, the answer is pretty easy - go in a straight line - but this is not very useful. So first, weâ€™ll add a safety requirement - that weâ€™d like to make this journey while avoiding obstacles. Then weâ€™ll want to make sure weâ€™re planning a feasible route - no sharp 180â€™s at supersonic speeds. And finally weâ€™d like to find the best route. Maybe best means shortest, or fastest, or most efficient. With all of these requirements, the task of path planning becomes much more challenging, but most solutions fall into one of four methods.</p>
