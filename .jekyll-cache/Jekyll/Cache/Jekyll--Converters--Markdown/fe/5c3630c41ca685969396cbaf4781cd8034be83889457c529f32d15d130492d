    <p>In dynamics, the goal is to predict the position, velocity, and acceleration of rigid bodies as a function of time through the use of Newton’s second law, F=ma. While the basic principle is simple, the key challenge of dynamics involves the definition of reference frames, vectors, and their relationships.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that F = ma is not the only way to solve dynamics problems! In the late 1700’s, Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced an energy conservation strategy, known today as the Euler-Lagrange Equations.</p>

    <p>A subset of dynamics, where forces are neglected, and we focus instead on the motion of points and rigid bodies over time. At the core of this topic are a series of rules about positions, velocities, accelerations, and how to find them amid a potentially messy system of reference frames and motion constraints.</p>

    <p>We’re almost ready to write down F = ma, but before that, we need to define what F is (a force), and what ma is (an intertial term).</p>
