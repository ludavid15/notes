<p>Just some closing thoughts on this topic, as well as some random notes and questions Iâ€™ve left for myself in the future.</p>

<p>In the second post on AI and Music, we discussed why itâ€™s difficult to generate music with AI. Along the way, we presented different learning <em>archictures</em>, and how they were applied to the problem through different <em>strategies</em>. Here is a quick summary of everything we went through:</p>

<h3 id="list-of-architectures">List of Architectures</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Feedforward</li>
  <li>Autoencoder</li>
  <li>Variational Autoencoder</li>
  <li>Restricted Boltzman Machine</li>
  <li>Recurrent Networks</li>
  <li>Convolutional Networks</li>
  <li>Conditioning Convolutional Networks</li>
  <li>Generative Adversarial Networks</li>
  <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="list-of-strategies">List of Strategies</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Single step feedforward</li>
  <li>Decoder feedforward</li>
  <li>Sampling based methods</li>
  <li>Iterative feedforward</li>
  <li>Input manipulation</li>
  <li>Reinforcement</li>
  <li>Unit Selection</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="list-of-challenges">List of Challenges</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Creatio Ex nihilo (creation from nothing)</li>
  <li>Length variability (music of different lengths)</li>
  <li>Content variability (is it deterministic?)</li>
  <li>Expressiveness (dynamics and feeling)</li>
  <li>Melody-harmony consistency</li>
  <li>Control (user ability to affect outcome)</li>
  <li>Style transfer (applicable to images, but can it apply to music?)</li>
  <li>Structure (songs formats, AABA, etc.)</li>
  <li>Originality (not just repeating information from training data)</li>
  <li>Incrementality</li>
  <li>Adaptability</li>
  <li>Explainability</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="recurrent-vs-convolutional-networks">Recurrent vs Convolutional Networks</h3>

<p>Convolutional networks have not been explored thoroughly as a way to generate or recognize music. Maybe this is because music representation is so complex that itâ€™s difficult to visualize how a CNN would apply.</p>

<p>That being said, convolutional networks do have two advantages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Faster to train and easier to parallelize</li>
  <li>By nature of their implementation, convolutional networks increase the volume of data.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="transfer-learning">Transfer Learning</h3>

<p>Transfer learning for music is another area that really hasnâ€™t been explored in depth, but which could be enormously useful, if we use the (more developed) subject of image generation as a sign of things to come.</p>
