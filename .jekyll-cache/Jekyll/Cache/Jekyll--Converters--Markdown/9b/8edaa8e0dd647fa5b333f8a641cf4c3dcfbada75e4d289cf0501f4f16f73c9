    <p>Have you ever been a DM and wondered what it means to roll with disadvantage? Or why some weapons are 2d6 instead of 1d12? It all has to do with the statistics of dice rolls!</p>

    <p>We’ve mentioned before that machine learning is really just glorified regression. But neural networks are just one way to do this. If we’re working with matrices, linear algrebra gives us many ways to extract patterns from our data as well.</p>
