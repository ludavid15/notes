I"@<p>A subset of dynamics, where forces are neglected, and we focus instead on the motion of points and rigid bodies over time. At the core of this topic are a series of rules about positions, velocities, accelerations, and how to find them amid a potentially messy system of reference frames and motion constraints.</p>
